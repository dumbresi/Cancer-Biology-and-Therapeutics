# Chapter 37: Cancer Survivorship

## Introduction

Cancer survivorship encompasses a complex and evolving field that addresses the needs of individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment and are transitioning to long-term follow-up care. The 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) consensus study report From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition made recommendations to improve the quality of care that cancer survivors receive, in recognition that cancer survivors are at risk for significant physical, psychosocial, and financial repercussions from cancer and its treatment. 

As of 2017, there are now more than 15.5 million cancer survivors in the United States and approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. This growing population faces unique challenges that extend well beyond their initial cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The definition of survivorship itself is complex and varies depending on perspective. For some, and as defined by the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship (NCCS), it begins at the time of diagnosis, when treatment decisions are being made. For others, survivorship refers to the time after cancer treatment, when some of the late effects become apparent.

## Long-Term Side Effects of Treatment

Cancer survivors face a wide range of potential long-term and late effects from their treatment, which can affect virtually every organ system. As many as two-thirds of survivors will experience a late effect of chemotherapy or radiation, defined as any chronic or late occurring outcome—physical or psychosocial—that persists or develops beyond five years from the diagnosis of the cancer.

### Physical Late Effects

The spectrum of physical late effects is extensive and varies depending on the type of cancer, treatment modality, dose, age at treatment, and individual patient factors. Kevin Oeffinger, director of the Duke Center for Onco-Primary Care and the Duke Cancer Institute Cancer Supportive Care and Survivorship Center, summarized the health risks that cancer survivors face following treatment and said many factors may contribute to the development of these late effects, including premorbid conditions; genetics; tumor factors; treatment factors; treatment events; host factors; health behaviors; and aging.

#### Cardiovascular Effects

Cardiovascular complications represent one of the most significant concerns for long-term survivors. Studies show a marked elevation in risk of coronary artery disease among both men and women treated with mediastinal radiotherapy. The risk for women aged 35, 45, and 50 is as high as for men of the same age, and there is a one in five chance of having symptomatic coronary artery disease by 20 years following moderate dose radiation to the mediastinal area.

For breast cancer survivors, more than half of those ages 65 or older have hypertension or lipid disorders, and a sizable fraction have diabetes. Hypertension, either before, during, or after cancer therapy, is the single most important predictor of heart failure in breast cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab.

#### Second Primary Cancers

The development of subsequent cancers represents another major concern. One out of every five new cancers diagnosed in the United States is a second, third, or fourth cancer for the patient. The factors contributing to a subsequent primary cancer include unhealthy behaviors (e.g., tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, obesity), aging (patients 65 and older account for two-thirds of cancers), genetic factors, treatment exposures from the first cancer, and interactions among these factors.

#### Fatigue and Sleep Disorders

Fatigue and disturbed sleep were the most common symptoms reported out of 13 possible symptoms in one survey of more than 2,800 patients with breast, colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer, with approximately 33 percent of patients who had completed primary cancer therapy reporting three or more moderate to severe symptoms.

Risk factors for persistent fatigue include the presence of pretreatment fatigue, greater body mass index, and the type of cancer treatment. Among women with early-stage breast cancer, those exposed to chemotherapy versus radiotherapy as their initial cancer treatment are more likely to have persistent posttreatment fatigue.

#### Cognitive Dysfunction

Cancer-related cognitive impairment, sometimes referred to as "chemobrain," affects a significant portion of survivors. Risk factors for posttreatment cognitive problems include older age, cognitive reserve (i.e., premorbid intellectual ability), and genetic polymorphisms that have been implicated as a risk factor for dementia or in genes known to regulate several neurotransmitters.

### Late Effects in Pediatric Survivors

Childhood cancer survivors face particular challenges due to their young age at treatment and the potential for treatment to interfere with normal development. Most children and young adults diagnosed with cancer prior to 1970 had little hope of being cured. By 1997, cure rates, as measured in 5-year survival, had risen to 78 percent, largely as a result of the development of intensive multimodal treatments.

However, more than 40 percent of pediatric cancer survivors develop a severe or life-threatening chronic health condition within 30 years of diagnosis. Overall, childhood cancer survivors have about a five- to six-fold increased risk of developing a secondary cancer.

## Psychosocial Challenges for Survivors

The psychological and social impact of cancer extends well beyond the completion of treatment, affecting survivors' mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life.

### Mental Health Issues

People with cancer face the risk of substantial and permanent physical impairment, disability, and inability to perform routine activities of daily living, as well as the psychological and social problems that can result from the diagnosis and its sequelae.

Cancer survivors experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to the general population. Cancer patients who are most at risk of psychological and/or behavioral difficulties include those with a prior history of anxiety or mood disorders; men; the aged (risk rises at age 55 and older); those who are alone, either actually or functionally; individuals who are unemployed or are of low socioeconomic status; patients receiving the most toxic therapies; and individuals with progressive disease or recurrence.

Research demonstrates that a meta-analysis of 50 studies showed a significantly heightened risk (hazard ratio of 1.34) for premature mortality among patients with breast, lung, stomach, or colorectal cancer who were also diagnosed with depression.

### Childhood Cancer Survivors' Psychosocial Challenges

Adult survivors of childhood cancer face unique psychological challenges. Adult survivors are twice as likely as sibling controls to report significant psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression. They are almost twice as likely to report suicide ideation and impaired mental health, and they are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms compared with their siblings.

Social adaptation is also affected, with survivors being approximately five times more likely to report functional impairment in health-related quality of life; about three times more likely to report using special education services; less likely to attend college; six times more likely to report unemployment related to health; and more likely to be unmarried.

### Fear of Recurrence and Uncertainty

One of the most persistent psychosocial challenges faced by survivors is the fear of cancer recurrence. Cancer survivors often face a range of health-related, financial, social, and psychological needs and concerns that may affect treatment and that may even persist well after diagnosis. The results revealed that length of survivorship is not necessarily associated with a diminishment of concerns about the cancer. Chronic physical problems, continued thoughts about recurrence, nervousness associated with medical follow-up, concerns regarding health insurance coverage, and other social concerns remain significant issues for many long-term survivors.

### Effective Interventions

Research has identified several effective psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors. Effective psychosocial interventions that reduce emotional distress and improve quality of life in high-risk patients typically include some sort of stress reduction strategy (e.g., relaxation training), information, behavioral and cognitive coping strategies (e.g., dealing with fatigue), social support, and focused interventions. Positive outcomes were found with psycho-education, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation, and mindfulness-based stress reduction.

## Rehabilitation and Reintegration

Rehabilitation plays a crucial role in helping cancer survivors return to optimal functioning and quality of life. Cancer rehabilitation can be broadly defined as the maximum restoration of physical, psychologic, social, vocational, recreational, and economic functions within the limits imposed by the malignancy and its treatment.

### Physical Rehabilitation

Many cancer survivors experience functional impairments that can benefit from rehabilitation services. In one study, 163 women with metastatic breast cancer reported a total of 530 physical impairments that were not detected during hospitalization, but which required physical therapy and/or occupational therapy. In another study of 529 older adults with cancer, 341 (approximately 64 percent) had potentially modifiable functional deficits and needed physical or occupational therapy, but only 9 percent of the patients with these impairments received such therapy.

### Prehabilitation

An emerging concept in cancer care is prehabilitation, which is designed to increase a patient's functional capacity prior to cancer treatment and is defined as a process on the cancer continuum of care that occurs between the time of diagnosis and the beginning of acute treatment and includes physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide targeted interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.

### Return to Work and Functional Capacity

Employment represents a critical aspect of survivorship for working-age cancer survivors. Among the approximately 15.5 million survivors in the United States, about 7 million are of working age. Return to work is a key element of quality of life, and survivors are very motivated to keep working to retain their health insurance and to combat financial toxicity, as well as to maintain a sense of normalcy, self-worth, and accomplishment that can come from work.

Factors affecting return to work include treatment characteristics, work environment factors, and patient characteristics. About half of women with breast cancer reported that cancer treatment interfered with their physical efforts at work. These women also reported difficulty with concentration (31 percent), the ability to do analysis (28 percent), keeping the pace set by others (39 percent), and learning new things (20 percent).

### Lifestyle Interventions

Research demonstrates significant benefits from lifestyle interventions for cancer survivors. Studies show associations among a variety of factors—such as obesity, physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use—and cancer risk. Obesity is associated with increased risk for 13 different cancers and obesity rates among cancer survivors have increased from 1992 to 2015. High levels of leisure-time physical activity are associated with lower risks of several cancers.

The American Cancer Society has developed specific guidelines for nutrition and physical activity for cancer survivors. A cancer diagnosis can provide impetus for behavior change, but few individuals can make necessary changes of substantive duration without support.

## Quality of Life after Cancer

Quality of life represents a multidimensional concept encompassing physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. For cancer survivors, quality of life is influenced by numerous factors including treatment-related effects, psychosocial adjustment, and social support.

### Factors Affecting Quality of Life

Following cancer treatment, poorly controlled symptoms contribute to poor quality of life and impaired physical and social functioning. Furthermore, they can contribute to non-adherence with or the discontinuation of oral therapies and to lower rates of return to work following cancer treatment and to impaired abilities among people who attempt to return to work.

### Family and Caregiver Impact

The impact of cancer extends beyond the patient to family members and caregivers. There were approximately 43.5 million adults in the United States providing care to an adult or child in the preceding 12 months, and cancer was identified as the fourth main reason for which people needed a family caregiver. The vast majority (88 percent) of cancer caregivers provide care to a relative.

Caregiving has significant effects on the caregiver's own well-being. Emotional distress such as anxiety and depression are high (approximately 38 percent) among caregivers at 2 years postdiagnosis and persist at 5 years (approximately 21 percent). The rates of anxiety and depression were higher among caregivers of cancer patients than they were for caregivers of other types of patients.

### Financial Impact on Quality of Life

Financial concerns represent a significant factor affecting quality of life for many cancer survivors. Financial hardship is relatively common among cancer survivors, even many years after treatment. Risk factors for financial hardship include younger age; being female; minority race or ethnicity; a recent cancer diagnosis or treatment; having lower socioeconomic status; and being unemployed or changing employment because of cancer.

The concept of "financial toxicity" has emerged to describe the harmful effects of treatment costs. Some immunotherapies and targeted agents now cost $25,000 or more per month, and even with insurance, cost-sharing provisions can mean significant out-of-pocket expenses for patients treated with these drugs, which may not offer a cure or even significant improvement in survival.

### Models of Survivorship Care

Various models of survivorship care have been developed to address the complex needs of cancer survivors. The structure of the model and type of clinician depend on the survivors' risk of recurrence and late effects, the types of services needed for comprehensive care, and the timing of those services, whether it is a one-time consultative visit or ongoing care.

Risk stratification is increasingly being used to determine appropriate levels of care:

- **High-risk survivors**: Those at very high risk for disease recurrence and morbidity related to late effects may benefit from a multidisciplinary care model with clinicians who have expertise in long-term effects
- **Moderate-risk survivors**: May benefit from disease-/treatment-specific clinics, integrated care clinics, or consultative approaches
- **Low-risk survivors**: May benefit from community generalist models of care with early transition to primary care clinicians

### Survivorship Care Plans

Survivorship care plans have become an important tool for facilitating communication and care coordination. The survivorship care plan is a vehicle to facilitate informed communications between the patient and the care team. The ideal care plan includes steps for positive health promotion and disease prevention, which patients find empowering as it represents an aspect of their health care that they can control.

## Conclusion

Cancer survivorship represents a complex and evolving field that addresses the multifaceted needs of individuals who have completed primary cancer treatment. As the number of cancer survivors continues to grow, healthcare systems must adapt to provide comprehensive, coordinated care that addresses not only the medical aspects of survivorship but also the psychosocial, economic, and quality of life concerns that survivors face.

The evidence demonstrates that cancer survivors experience significant long-term and late effects from their treatment, including physical complications, psychological distress, and social challenges. However, research also shows that many of these effects can be effectively managed through appropriate screening, early intervention, rehabilitation services, and supportive care.

Moving forward, the field of cancer survivorship will benefit from continued research into effective interventions, improved models of care delivery, better integration of services, and policies that support survivors' comprehensive needs. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all cancer survivors receive high-quality, patient-centered care that enables them to achieve optimal health and quality of life after cancer treatment.
