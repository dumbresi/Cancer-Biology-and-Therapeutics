# Chapter 4: Genetics and Genomic Instability in Cancer

## 4.1 DNA Structure and Replication

The relationship between DNA and cancer is fundamental, as cancer is ultimately a disease of altered genetic information. Understanding DNA structure and the replication process provides critical insights into how genetic alterations arise and how they contribute to carcinogenesis.

### 4.1.1 DNA Structure and Organization

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) serves as the repository of genetic information in all living organisms. Its structure, first described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 based on X-ray crystallography data from Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, consists of two polynucleotide strands coiled around each other in a double helix.

**Nucleotides and the Sugar-Phosphate Backbone**

The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, each composed of three components:

1. **Deoxyribose sugar**: A five-carbon sugar that forms the central component of the nucleotide
2. **Phosphate group**: Connects the sugars of adjacent nucleotides, forming the sugar-phosphate backbone
3. **Nitrogenous base**: One of four organic bases that extend inward from the backbone

The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are:
- **Purines**: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) – larger, double-ring structures
- **Pyrimidines**: Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) – smaller, single-ring structures

These bases are attached to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose sugar, while the phosphate group links the 3' carbon of one sugar to the 5' carbon of the next, creating directional strands with 5' and 3' ends.

**Complementary Base Pairing and the Double Helix**

The two strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs:
- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) through two hydrogen bonds
- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) through three hydrogen bonds

This complementary base pairing results in several key features:
- The two strands run in opposite directions (antiparallel)
- The strands are complementary rather than identical
- The diameter of the helix remains uniform due to the consistent pairing of one purine with one pyrimidine
- The bases are stacked in the center of the helix, with the sugar-phosphate backbone on the outside
- The helix makes a complete turn every 10.5 base pairs in the B-form of DNA (the most common form in cells)

The structure creates major and minor grooves along the helix, which serve as binding sites for proteins involved in DNA replication, repair, and gene expression.

**DNA Packaging and Chromosomes**

The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs, which must be compacted to fit within the nucleus. This is achieved through multiple levels of organization:

1. **Nucleosomes**: The basic unit of DNA packaging, consisting of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (composed of two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4)

2. **Chromatin fiber**: Nucleosomes packed together, often described as a "beads-on-a-string" structure, which can be further compacted into a 30-nm fiber through interactions between nucleosomes

3. **Chromatin loops and domains**: Higher-order structures formed through the interaction of specific DNA sequences with nuclear scaffold proteins

4. **Chromosome territories**: Specific regions of the nucleus occupied by individual chromosomes during interphase

5. **Chromosomes**: The most condensed form of DNA, visible during cell division, with each chromosome containing a single, continuous DNA molecule

In humans, the genome is organized into 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) in most somatic cells. The packaging of DNA is not merely structural but plays crucial roles in regulating gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair – processes that can be disrupted in cancer.

**Euchromatin and Heterochromatin**

DNA exists in different states of compaction within the nucleus:

- **Euchromatin**: Less condensed, transcriptionally active regions of chromatin where genes are accessible to the transcriptional machinery
- **Heterochromatin**: Highly condensed, generally transcriptionally silent regions, further classified as:
  - **Constitutive heterochromatin**: Permanently condensed regions, often containing repetitive sequences
  - **Facultative heterochromatin**: Regions that can switch between condensed and decondensed states depending on cellular context

The balance between euchromatin and heterochromatin is regulated by various mechanisms, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling complexes. Alterations in these regulatory mechanisms are common in cancer and can lead to inappropriate gene expression or silencing.

### 4.1.2 DNA Replication Process

DNA replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division, ensuring that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material. This process is remarkably precise, with an error rate of only about one mistake per billion base pairs in normal human cells.

**Initiation of DNA Replication**

Replication begins at specific sites called origins of replication, which in humans are defined more by chromatin structure than by specific DNA sequences. The process involves several steps:

1. **Origin recognition**: The Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) binds to replication origins
2. **Pre-replicative complex assembly**: Additional proteins, including Cdc6 and Cdt1, recruit the MCM (minichromosome maintenance) helicase complex
3. **Helicase activation**: The MCM complex is activated by kinases (CDK and DDK), transforming the pre-replicative complex into an active replication fork
4. **Recruitment of replication machinery**: Additional proteins, including DNA polymerases, primase, and other factors, are recruited to form the replisome

Human cells contain thousands of replication origins, which are activated in a temporally regulated manner throughout S phase, with some regions of the genome consistently replicating early and others late.

**DNA Synthesis**

Once initiated, DNA synthesis proceeds through several coordinated steps:

1. **Unwinding**: The MCM helicase complex unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork with single-stranded DNA
2. **Primer synthesis**: DNA primase (a specialized RNA polymerase) synthesizes short RNA primers (approximately 10 nucleotides long) that provide the 3'-OH group required for DNA polymerase activity
3. **Leading strand synthesis**: DNA polymerase ε extends the primer continuously in the 5' to 3' direction following the replication fork
4. **Lagging strand synthesis**: On the opposite template strand, DNA polymerase δ synthesizes DNA discontinuously in short fragments (Okazaki fragments) in the 5' to 3' direction, requiring multiple priming events
5. **Primer removal**: RNase H and FEN1 (flap endonuclease 1) remove RNA primers
6. **Gap filling and ligation**: DNA polymerase δ fills the gaps left by primer removal, and DNA ligase seals the nicks between adjacent Okazaki fragments

This process continues until the entire genome is replicated, with each newly synthesized strand paired with one of the original parental strands (semi-conservative replication).

**Replication Fork Proteins**

The replication fork is a complex molecular machine comprising numerous proteins with specialized functions:

- **Helicases (MCM2-7)**: Unwind the DNA double helix
- **Single-strand binding proteins (RPA)**: Stabilize single-stranded DNA and prevent secondary structure formation
- **Topoisomerases**: Relieve torsional stress ahead of the replication fork
- **Primase**: Synthesizes RNA primers
- **DNA polymerases**: Synthesize new DNA strands
  - **Polymerase α**: Has primase activity and initiates DNA synthesis
  - **Polymerase δ**: Primarily synthesizes the lagging strand
  - **Polymerase ε**: Primarily synthesizes the leading strand
- **PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)**: Forms a sliding clamp that increases polymerase processivity
- **RFC (Replication Factor C)**: Loads the PCNA clamp onto DNA
- **FEN1 (Flap Endonuclease 1)**: Removes RNA primers on the lagging strand
- **DNA ligase**: Seals nicks in the DNA backbone
- **RNase H**: Degrades RNA primers

Mutations in genes encoding these replication proteins can lead to replication errors, genomic instability, and increased cancer susceptibility.

**Replication Termination**

Replication termination occurs when two replication forks meet or when a fork reaches the end of a linear chromosome:

1. **Fork convergence**: When two forks meet, the replicated DNA is separated from the replication machinery
2. **Decatenation**: DNA topoisomerase II resolves the intertwined daughter molecules
3. **Telomere replication**: Special mechanisms address the "end replication problem" at chromosome termini, involving telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathways

Proper termination is essential for genome integrity, and defects in this process can lead to incomplete replication, DNA breaks, or chromosomal rearrangements.

### 4.1.3 Regulation of DNA Replication

DNA replication is tightly regulated to ensure that it occurs only once per cell cycle and that the entire genome is accurately duplicated.

**Cell Cycle Control of Replication**

The initiation of DNA replication is coordinated with cell cycle progression:

1. **G1 phase**: Pre-replicative complexes form at origins when CDK activity is low
2. **G1/S transition**: Increasing CDK activity triggers origin firing
3. **S phase**: Origins fire in a temporally programmed sequence
4. **G2 phase**: High CDK activity prevents re-formation of pre-replicative complexes, ensuring that each origin fires only once per cell cycle

This regulation involves multiple mechanisms:
- Phosphorylation of replication proteins by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
- Regulated degradation of replication factors
- Nuclear export of key proteins
- Chromatin modifications that affect origin accessibility

Dysregulation of these control mechanisms can lead to re-replication (multiple rounds of replication from the same origin within one cell cycle), which causes DNA damage and genomic instability – hallmarks of cancer cells.

**Replication Timing and Nuclear Organization**

The replication of the human genome follows a specific temporal program, with different regions replicating at characteristic times during S phase:

- **Early-replicating regions**: Typically gene-rich, transcriptionally active euchromatin
- **Late-replicating regions**: Often gene-poor, heterochromatic regions, including most pericentromeric and telomeric sequences

This timing program is correlated with:
- Nuclear positioning
- Chromatin structure
- Histone modifications
- Transcriptional activity

Alterations in replication timing are observed in cancer cells and may contribute to genomic instability by affecting the collision of replication and transcription machinery or by changing the environment in which DNA damage is repaired.

**Replication Stress and Checkpoint Activation**

When replication is compromised – for example, by nucleotide depletion, DNA damage, or difficult-to-replicate sequences – replication forks can stall or collapse. This replication stress activates checkpoint mechanisms:

1. **Stalled fork detection**: Accumulation of single-stranded DNA and recruitment of ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) kinase
2. **Checkpoint activation**: Phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins, including Chk1
3. **Cellular responses**:
   - Inhibition of late origin firing
   - Stabilization of stalled forks
   - Activation of DNA repair mechanisms
   - Cell cycle arrest
   - In cases of severe stress, senescence or apoptosis

Cancer cells often exhibit chronic replication stress due to oncogene activation, which can both promote genomic instability (by increasing mutation rates) and serve as an Achilles' heel for therapeutic targeting.

### 4.1.4 DNA Replication and Cancer

Defects in DNA replication are closely linked to carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms.

**Replication Errors and Mutagenesis**

Despite the high fidelity of DNA polymerases, errors during replication can introduce mutations:

- **Base substitutions**: Incorporation of incorrect nucleotides due to rare tautomeric forms of bases or polymerase errors
- **Insertions and deletions**: Often occurring in repetitive sequences due to template slippage
- **Complex mutations**: Including multiple nucleotide changes within a short DNA segment

The frequency of these errors is influenced by:
- Intrinsic error rates of DNA polymerases
- Efficiency of proofreading activities
- Post-replicative mismatch repair
- DNA damage that creates ambiguous templates
- Replication timing and chromatin context

Elevated mutation rates due to replication errors can increase the probability of cancer-driving mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

**Oncogene-Induced Replication Stress**

Activation of oncogenes such as MYC, RAS, and CCNE1 (cyclin E1) can disrupt normal replication by:

1. **Increased origin firing**: Leading to depletion of replication factors and nucleotides
2. **Altered replication timing**: Disrupting the normal temporal program of replication
3. **R-loop formation**: Increasing conflicts between replication and transcription machinery
4. **Replication through fragile sites**: Causing breaks at genomically unstable regions

This oncogene-induced replication stress creates a selective pressure for mutations that inactivate DNA damage checkpoints (e.g., TP53 mutations), allowing cancer cells to tolerate the stress and continue proliferating despite genomic damage.

**Hereditary Cancer Syndromes Linked to Replication Defects**

Several inherited cancer predisposition syndromes involve mutations in genes encoding replication proteins:

- **Lynch syndrome**: Caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes, which normally correct replication errors
- **POLE/POLD1-associated cancer predisposition**: Mutations affecting the proofreading domains of replicative DNA polymerases
- **Rothmund-Thomson syndrome**: Caused by mutations in the RECQL4 helicase involved in replication initiation
- **Seckel syndrome**: Can be caused by mutations in ATR, which responds to replication stress

These syndromes highlight the importance of faithful DNA replication and replication stress responses in preventing cancer development.

**Therapeutic Targeting of Replication in Cancer**

Understanding DNA replication has led to the development of numerous cancer therapeutics:

- **Antimetabolites** (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine): Interfere with nucleotide synthesis or incorporation
- **Topoisomerase inhibitors** (e.g., etoposide, irinotecan): Prevent resolution of topological stress during replication
- **DNA crosslinking agents** (e.g., cisplatin, mitomycin C): Create lesions that block replication forks
- **PARP inhibitors** (e.g., olaparib): Exploit synthetic lethality in cancers with defective homologous recombination
- **Replication checkpoint inhibitors** (e.g., ATR or Chk1 inhibitors): Exploit high levels of replication stress in cancer cells

These approaches take advantage of the increased reliance of cancer cells on DNA replication and repair mechanisms to selectively target malignant cells while sparing normal tissues.

## 4.2 Mutations: Types and Consequences

Mutations – heritable changes in the genetic material – are the driving force behind cancer development. Understanding the types, causes, and consequences of mutations provides insight into carcinogenesis and informs approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

### 4.2.1 Classification of Mutations

Mutations can be classified in multiple ways, including by their size, effect on DNA sequence, origin, and functional impact.

**Classification by Size and Genomic Impact**

Mutations vary greatly in the amount of genetic material they affect:

- **Point mutations**: Changes affecting a single nucleotide
  - **Substitutions**: Replacement of one nucleotide with another
    - **Transitions**: Purine-to-purine (A↔G) or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine (C↔T) changes
    - **Transversions**: Purine-to-pyrimidine or pyrimidine-to-purine changes
  - **Insertions**: Addition of one nucleotide
  - **Deletions**: Loss of one nucleotide

- **Oligonucleotide mutations**: Affecting a small number of consecutive nucleotides
  - **Multinucleotide substitutions**: Changes in multiple adjacent nucleotides
  - **Small insertions or deletions ("indels")**: Addition or removal of several nucleotides

- **Structural variations**: Larger changes affecting substantial portions of chromosomes
  - **Copy number variations (CNVs)**: Duplications or deletions of genomic segments
  - **Inversions**: Reversal of a DNA segment's orientation
  - **Translocations**: Exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes
  - **Insertions of mobile elements**: Integration of transposable elements into new locations

- **Whole chromosome alterations**: Changes in the number of entire chromosomes
  - **Aneuploidy**: Abnormal chromosome number not a multiple of the haploid set
  - **Polyploidy**: Multiple complete sets of chromosomes

**Classification by Functional Impact**

Mutations can be categorized based on their effects on protein-coding sequences:

- **Silent (synonymous) mutations**: Nucleotide changes that do not alter the amino acid sequence due to the redundancy of the genetic code
- **Missense mutations**: Nucleotide changes that result in substitution of one amino acid for another
  - **Conservative**: Substitution with an amino acid of similar biochemical properties
  - **Non-conservative**: Substitution with an amino acid of different properties
- **Nonsense mutations**: Changes that introduce a premature stop codon, truncating the protein
- **Frameshift mutations**: Insertions or deletions that are not multiples of three nucleotides, altering the reading frame and typically changing all downstream amino acids
- **Splice site mutations**: Changes at intron-exon boundaries that affect mRNA splicing
- **Noncoding mutations**: Changes in regulatory regions, introns, or other non-protein-coding sequences
  - **Promoter mutations**: Affect transcription factor binding and gene expression
  - **Enhancer/silencer mutations**: Alter long-range regulatory elements
  - **UTR mutations**: Affect mRNA stability or translation efficiency
  - **ncRNA mutations**: Impact non-coding RNAs like microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs

**Classification by Origin**

Mutations can also be categorized based on their source:

- **Germline mutations**: Present in germ cells (sperm or eggs) and transmitted to offspring
  - Found in all cells of the body
  - Can predispose to hereditary cancer syndromes
  - Examples include mutations in BRCA1/2, APC, TP53 in Li-Fraumeni syndrome

- **Somatic mutations**: Acquired during a person's lifetime in body cells
  - Present only in the cell where they originated and its descendants
  - Most cancer-causing mutations are somatic
  - Accumulate with age and exposure to mutagens

- **Mosaic mutations**: Occur early in development, affecting some but not all cells
  - Intermediate between germline and somatic
  - Can predispose to cancer if present in susceptible tissues
  - Examples include mosaic NF1 or APC mutations

### 4.2.2 Mechanisms of Mutation

Mutations arise through various mechanisms, reflecting both endogenous cellular processes and exogenous influences.

**Spontaneous Mutations**

Several processes can generate mutations in the absence of external mutagens:

- **Replication errors**: Despite proofreading mechanisms, DNA polymerases occasionally incorporate incorrect nucleotides
- **Tautomeric shifts**: Temporary alterations in nucleotide structure change base-pairing properties
- **Depurination**: Spontaneous loss of purine bases creates abasic sites
- **Deamination**: Spontaneous removal of amino groups
  - Cytosine to uracil (read as thymine after replication)
  - 5-methylcytosine to thymine (leading to C→T transitions at CpG sites)
- **Oxidative damage**: Reactive oxygen species generated by cellular metabolism create various DNA lesions, including 8-oxoguanine

These spontaneous processes contribute to "background" mutation rates, estimated at approximately 1×10^-10 to 1×10^-9 mutations per base pair per cell division in normal human cells.

**Induced Mutations**

Various environmental agents can increase mutation rates:

- **Physical mutagens**:
  - **Ionizing radiation** (X-rays, gamma rays): Creates single and double-strand breaks, base damage
  - **Ultraviolet radiation**: Forms pyrimidine dimers and other photoproducts
  - **Heat**: Can increase rates of depurination and other spontaneous DNA damage

- **Chemical mutagens**:
  - **Alkylating agents**: Add alkyl groups to DNA bases (e.g., aflatoxin B1, nitrosamines)
  - **Intercalating agents**: Insert between base pairs, causing frameshift mutations (e.g., ethidium bromide)
  - **Base analogs**: Incorporated into DNA during replication but with altered base-pairing properties (e.g., 5-bromouracil)
  - **Crosslinking agents**: Create covalent bonds between DNA strands (e.g., cisplatin)

- **Biological mutagens**:
  - **Viruses**: Some viral infections increase mutation rates
  - **Bacteria**: Certain bacterial toxins can damage DNA
  - **Transposable elements**: Mobile genetic elements that can insert into new locations

Exposure to these mutagens increases the probability of acquiring cancer-driving mutations, explaining many environmental cancer risk factors.

**Mutational Signatures**

Different mutational processes leave characteristic patterns or "signatures" in the genome, detectable through next-generation sequencing:

- **Signature 1**: Age-related, characterized by C→T transitions at CpG sites due to spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine
- **Signatures 2 and 13**: Associated with APOBEC enzyme activity, showing C→T and C→G mutations in specific sequence contexts
- **Signature 4**: Tobacco smoking signature, featuring C→A transversions from bulky adducts
- **Signature 7**: UV exposure signature, with C→T transitions at dipyrimidine sites
- **Signatures 6, 15, 20, 26**: Associated with defective DNA mismatch repair
- **Signature 3**: Homologous recombination deficiency (e.g., BRCA1/2 mutations)

Over 50 mutational signatures have been identified in human cancers, providing insights into cancer etiology and sometimes informing treatment decisions.

### 4.2.3 Functional Consequences of Mutations

The impact of mutations depends on their location, nature, and cellular context. In cancer, mutations drive malignant transformation by affecting key cellular processes.

**Mutations in Protein-Coding Genes**

Mutations can alter protein function in various ways:

- **Loss of function**: Impairment or elimination of normal protein activity
  - Often resulting from nonsense, frameshift, or severe missense mutations
  - Typically recessive at the cellular level, requiring inactivation of both alleles
  - Common mechanism for tumor suppressor gene inactivation (e.g., TP53, RB1)

- **Gain of function**: Acquisition of new or enhanced protein activity
  - Often resulting from specific missense mutations or gene amplification
  - Typically dominant at the cellular level
  - Common mechanism for oncogene activation (e.g., KRAS G12D, BRAF V600E)

- **Dominant negative effect**: Mutant protein interferes with normal protein function
  - Often occurs in proteins that function as dimers or multimers
  - Example: Some TP53 mutations not only inactivate the mutant allele but also impair the function of wild-type p53

- **Neomorphic function**: Acquisition of entirely new activities not related to the normal protein function
  - Example: IDH1/2 mutations in gliomas and leukemias, producing the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate

**Mutations in Regulatory Elements**

Mutations outside protein-coding regions can affect gene expression:

- **Promoter mutations**: Alter binding of transcription factors
  - Example: TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and other cancers, creating new transcription factor binding sites and increasing telomerase expression

- **Enhancer/silencer mutations**: Affect long-range regulatory elements
  - Example: Duplication of an enhancer element driving MYC expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

- **Splicing mutations**: Alter mRNA processing
  - Can create new splice sites or disrupt existing ones
  - Example: SF3B1 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes affecting recognition of 3' splice sites

- **3' UTR mutations**: Affect mRNA stability or translation
  - Often involve microRNA binding sites
  - Example: Mutations in the 3' UTR of HMGA2 disrupting let-7 microRNA regulation

**Global Consequences of Mutation Accumulation**

Beyond individual gene effects, the accumulation of mutations can have broader impacts:

- **Mutator phenotype**: Mutations in DNA repair genes can exponentially increase mutation rates
  - Example: Mismatch repair deficiency in Lynch syndrome and some sporadic cancers

- **Chromosomal instability**: Mutations affecting chromosome segregation or DNA repair can lead to ongoing chromosomal aberrations
  - Example: Mutations in spindle assembly checkpoint genes like BUB1

- **Clonal evolution**: The progressive accumulation of mutations drives cancer evolution through selection of increasingly malignant subclones
  - Example: Progression from adenoma to carcinoma in colorectal cancer through sequential mutations in APC, KRAS, and TP53

### 4.2.4 Driver and Passenger Mutations

Not all mutations in cancer cells contribute equally to the malignant phenotype. A key distinction exists between driver and passenger mutations.

**Driver Mutations**

Driver mutations confer a selective advantage to cancer cells, promoting aspects of malignant transformation such as increased proliferation, survival, or invasion. Key features include:

- **Functional impact**: Alter the function of cancer genes (oncogenes or tumor suppressors)
- **Positive selection**: Undergo positive selection during cancer evolution
- **Recurrence**: Often found in the same gene across multiple patients
- **Clustering**: Frequently cluster in functional domains of proteins
- **Timing**: May occur early (truncal drivers) or late (branch drivers) during cancer evolution
- **Number**: Typical solid tumors contain 2-8 driver mutations, though this varies by cancer type

Examples include:
- KRAS G12D mutation in pancreatic cancer
- BRAF V600E mutation in melanoma
- TP53 mutations in multiple cancer types
- EGFR kinase domain mutations in lung adenocarcinoma

**Passenger Mutations**

Passenger mutations do not directly contribute to cancer development but accumulate due to the genomic instability of cancer cells or exposure to mutagens:

- **Functional impact**: Minimal or no effect on cancer-related processes
- **Selection**: Not subject to positive selection
- **Distribution**: More randomly distributed across the genome
- **Number**: Greatly outnumber driver mutations, with typical solid tumors containing hundreds to thousands of passengers

While not driving cancer progression themselves, passenger mutations:
- Provide information about mutational processes active in the tumor
- Create neoantigens that may be recognized by the immune system
- Occasionally become relevant under selective pressures like therapy

**Identifying Driver Mutations**

Distinguishing drivers from passengers is a central challenge in cancer genomics, addressed through several approaches:

- **Recurrence analysis**: Identifying mutations that occur more frequently than expected by chance
- **Functional impact prediction**: Computational methods assessing the likely effect of mutations on protein function
- **Evolutionary conservation**: Mutations in highly conserved residues are more likely to be functional
- **Experimental validation**: Direct testing of mutational effects in cellular or animal models
- **Clinical correlation**: Association of mutations with clinical features or outcomes

Advanced techniques like saturation mutagenesis and CRISPR screens have further refined our ability to identify driver mutations and distinguish them from passengers.

### 4.2.5 Mutational Burden and Cancer

The total number of mutations in a cancer – its mutational burden – varies widely across cancer types and has important clinical implications.

**Variation in Mutational Burden**

Tumor mutational burden (TMB) varies by orders of magnitude across cancer types:

- **High TMB cancers** (>10 mutations per megabase):
  - Melanoma (especially UV-associated)
  - Lung cancers (especially smoking-associated)
  - Bladder cancer
  - Cancers with mismatch repair deficiency or POLE/POLD1 mutations

- **Intermediate TMB cancers** (1-10 mutations per megabase):
  - Most solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers

- **Low TMB cancers** (<1 mutation per megabase):
  - Most pediatric cancers
  - Leukemias
  - Neuroendocrine tumors
  - Mesothelioma

Factors influencing TMB include:
- Patient age (more mutations accumulate over time)
- Exposure to mutagens (e.g., UV, tobacco)
- DNA repair deficiencies
- Cancer type and cell of origin

**Clinical Implications of Mutational Burden**

TMB has emerged as an important biomarker with several clinical implications:

- **Immunotherapy response**: Higher TMB correlates with better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors across multiple cancer types, likely due to increased neoantigen load
- **Prognosis**: The relationship between TMB and prognosis varies by cancer type and treatment context
- **Therapeutic targeting**: Cancers with specific DNA repair deficiencies may be sensitive to targeted therapies (e.g., PARP inhibitors for homologous recombination-deficient tumors)
- **Cancer prevention**: Understanding the mutational processes driving high TMB informs prevention strategies (e.g., UV protection for melanoma prevention)

TMB measurement has been incorporated into clinical practice to guide immunotherapy decisions, with the FDA approving pembrolizumab for TMB-high (≥10 mutations/megabase) solid tumors regardless of tumor type.

## 4.3 Chromosomal Abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities are hallmarks of cancer cells and play crucial roles in cancer initiation, progression, and evolution. These abnormalities range from numerical changes affecting entire chromosomes to structural rearrangements involving parts of chromosomes.

### 4.3.1 Numerical Chromosomal Abnormalities

Numerical chromosomal abnormalities involve changes in the number of whole chromosomes, disrupting the normal diploid complement.

**Aneuploidy**

Aneuploidy refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes that is not a multiple of the haploid set (23 in humans):

- **Hyperdiploidy**: More than 46 chromosomes but not a multiple of 23
  - **Trisomy**: Presence of three copies of a particular chromosome (e.g., trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia)
  - **Tetrasomy**: Four copies of a chromosome
  - **Complex hyperdiploidy**: Multiple additional chromosomes

- **Hypodiploidy**: Fewer than 46 chromosomes
  - **Monosomy**: Loss of one chromosome (e.g., monosomy 7 in myelodysplastic syndromes)
  - **Nullisomy**: Loss of both copies of a chromosome (rare and usually lethal)
  - **Complex hypodiploidy**: Loss of multiple chromosomes

Aneuploidy is found in approximately 90% of solid tumors and 75% of hematologic malignancies, though the specific patterns vary by cancer type.

**Polyploidy**

Polyploidy involves multiple complete sets of chromosomes:

- **Triploidy**: Three complete sets (69 chromosomes in humans)
- **Tetraploidy**: Four complete sets (92 chromosomes in humans)
- **Higher-degree polyploidy**: Five or more sets

Polyploidy in cancer can arise through:
- Cell fusion
- Endoreplication (DNA replication without cell division)
- Mitotic slippage (exit from mitosis without chromosome segregation)
- Cytokinesis failure (failure of cytoplasmic division)

Tetraploidization is increasingly recognized as an important intermediate step in cancer progression, often preceding chromosomal instability and aneuploidy.

**Mechanisms of Numerical Chromosomal Abnormalities**

Several mechanisms contribute to the generation of numerical chromosomal abnormalities:

- **Mitotic errors**:
  - **Chromosome non-disjunction**: Failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis
  - **Spindle assembly checkpoint defects**: Allowing anaphase to proceed despite improper chromosome attachment
  - **Multipolar spindles**: Resulting from supernumerary centrosomes
  - **Merotelic attachments**: Single kinetochores attached to microtubules from both poles

- **Cytokinesis failure**: Leading to binucleated cells that can progress to tetraploidy

- **Chromosome missegregation**: Due to cohesion defects, condensation abnormalities, or centromere dysfunction

Cancer cells often exhibit ongoing chromosomal instability (CIN), with elevated rates of chromosome missegregation during each cell division, leading to heterogeneous karyotypes within a tumor.

**Consequences of Numerical Chromosomal Abnormalities**

Numerical chromosomal abnormalities have profound effects on cellular physiology and cancer development:

- **Gene dosage imbalance**: Altered expression of hundreds to thousands of genes
- **Proteotoxic stress**: Imbalanced protein production straining cellular proteostasis
- **Metabolic alterations**: Changes in energy requirements and metabolic pathways
- **Genomic instability**: Increased rates of further chromosomal aberrations
- **Immune modulation**: Altered interactions with the immune system
- **Therapy resistance**: Changes in drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms

The relationship between aneuploidy and cancer is complex:
- Severe aneuploidy is typically detrimental to normal cells, activating p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or death
- Cancer cells develop adaptations to tolerate aneuploidy, often through TP53 mutations
- Specific patterns of aneuploidy can be selected during cancer evolution if they provide advantages like increased oncogene dosage or decreased tumor suppressor dosage

### 4.3.2 Structural Chromosomal Abnormalities

Structural chromosomal abnormalities involve rearrangements of chromosome segments rather than changes in whole chromosome numbers.

**Deletions**

Chromosomal deletions involve the loss of a chromosome segment:

- **Terminal deletions**: Loss of the end portion of a chromosome
- **Interstitial deletions**: Loss of an internal segment, with the remaining portions rejoining
- **Microdeletions**: Small deletions, often <5 megabases, sometimes affecting a single gene

Deletions are particularly important in cancer when they involve tumor suppressor genes, contributing to the "two-hit" model of tumor suppression:
- Loss of a chromosome segment containing a tumor suppressor gene
- When combined with a mutation in the remaining allele, this leads to complete inactivation
- Examples include deletions of chromosome 17p (containing TP53) in various cancers and 13q (containing RB1) in retinoblastoma and other tumors

**Duplications**

Duplications involve the presence of extra copies of a chromosome segment:

- **Tandem duplications**: Extra copies adjacent to the original sequence
- **Insertional duplications**: Extra copies inserted elsewhere in the genome
- **Amplifications**: Multiple copies of a region, sometimes present as:
  - **Homogeneously staining regions (HSRs)**: Integrated into chromosomes
  - **Double minutes**: Extrachromosomal circular DNA fragments

Amplification of oncogenes is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer:
- MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma
- ERBB2 (HER2) amplification in breast and gastric cancers
- EGFR amplification in glioblastoma
- CCND1 (cyclin D1) amplification in breast and other cancers

**Inversions**

Inversions involve the reversal of a chromosome segment's orientation:

- **Paracentric inversions**: Do not include the centromere
- **Pericentric inversions**: Include the centromere

While inversions do not necessarily change gene dosage, they can:
- Disrupt genes at the breakpoints
- Create gene fusions
- Alter gene regulation by repositioning regulatory elements

Examples in cancer include:
- Inversion inv(16) in acute myeloid leukemia, creating the CBFB-MYH11 fusion
- Inversion inv(2) in thyroid cancer, leading to the RET/PTC1 rearrangement

**Translocations**

Translocations involve the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes:

- **Balanced translocations**: Exchange of material without net gain or loss
  - **Reciprocal**: Two-way exchange between chromosomes
  - **Complex**: Involving three or more chromosomes
  
- **Unbalanced translocations**: Exchange resulting in net gain or loss of genetic material

Translocations are particularly important in hematologic malignancies and sarcomas, often creating fusion oncogenes:
- t(9;22) in chronic myeloid leukemia, creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion
- t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma, juxtaposing BCL2 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer
- t(X;18) in synovial sarcoma, creating the SS18-SSX fusion
- t(12;16) in myxoid liposarcoma, creating the FUS-DDIT3 fusion

**Chromothripsis and Chromoplexy**

More complex chromosomal rearrangements have been identified through advanced genomic technologies:

- **Chromothripsis**: Catastrophic shattering and reassembly of one or a few chromosomes
  - Results in oscillating copy number states
  - Multiple clustered rearrangements
  - Often associated with poor prognosis
  - May involve micronuclei formation and chromosome pulverization

- **Chromoplexy**: Complex chained rearrangements involving multiple chromosomes
  - Common in prostate cancer
  - Can simultaneously dysregulate multiple cancer genes
  - May result from coordinated repair of multiple DNA breaks

These phenomena represent single catastrophic events rather than the progressive accumulation of individual rearrangements, challenging traditional views of gradual cancer evolution.

### 4.3.3 Methods for Detecting Chromosomal Abnormalities

Various techniques are used to detect chromosomal abnormalities in cancer, each with specific advantages and limitations.

**Conventional Cytogenetics (Karyotyping)**

Karyotyping involves the visualization of chromosomes during metaphase:

- **Process**: Cells are cultured, arrested in metaphase, stained (typically with Giemsa), and analyzed microscopically
- **Resolution**: Approximately 5-10 megabases
- **Advantages**: Provides a global view of both numerical and structural abnormalities
- **Limitations**: Requires dividing cells, labor-intensive, limited resolution

Karyotyping remains important in hematologic malignancies where specific chromosomal abnormalities guide diagnosis and treatment.

**Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)**

FISH uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes to detect specific chromosomal regions:

- **Process**: DNA probes hybridize to complementary sequences in fixed cells, visualized by fluorescence microscopy
- **Types**:
  - **Locus-specific probes**: Target specific genes or regions
  - **Centromeric probes**: Detect chromosome number
  - **Whole chromosome painting probes**: Highlight entire chromosomes
  - **Break-apart probes**: Detect rearrangements by separating signals
  - **Fusion probes**: Detect specific translocations by signal colocalization
- **Advantages**: Works on non-dividing cells, higher resolution than karyotyping, targeted approach
- **Limitations**: Detects only the specific regions targeted by probes

FISH is widely used for detecting specific abnormalities with diagnostic or therapeutic implications, such as HER2 amplification in breast cancer or ALK rearrangements in lung cancer.

**Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH)**

CGH compares the copy number of genomic regions between tumor and normal DNA:

- **Process**: Tumor and reference DNA are differentially labeled, co-hybridized to normal metaphase spreads (conventional CGH) or microarrays (array CGH), and the ratio of signals indicates copy number changes
- **Resolution**: Array CGH can detect changes as small as 5-10 kilobases
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive view of copy number alterations, does not require dividing cells
- **Limitations**: Cannot detect balanced rearrangements or alterations in repetitive regions

Array CGH has been largely superseded by next-generation sequencing approaches but remains useful in some clinical settings.

**Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Approaches**

Various NGS methods can detect chromosomal abnormalities:

- **Whole genome sequencing (WGS)**: Sequences the entire genome
  - Can detect all types of structural variations
  - Highest resolution and most comprehensive
  - Relatively expensive, complex data analysis

- **Whole exome sequencing (WES)**: Sequences protein-coding regions
  - Can detect copy number changes and some structural variations affecting exons
  - Less comprehensive than WGS for structural variations
  - More cost-effective than WGS

- **Targeted panel sequencing**: Sequences selected genes or regions
  - Limited to detecting abnormalities in targeted regions
  - Most cost-effective, focused approach
  - Many clinical assays use this approach

- **RNA sequencing**: Sequences the transcriptome
  - Particularly effective for detecting gene fusions
  - Provides functional evidence of chromosomal rearrangements
  - Complements DNA-based methods

These NGS approaches have revolutionized the detection of chromosomal abnormalities, providing unprecedented resolution and comprehensiveness.

### 4.3.4 Clinical Significance of Chromosomal Abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities in cancer have significant implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

**Diagnostic Applications**

Specific chromosomal abnormalities serve as diagnostic markers for certain cancer types:

- **Hematologic malignancies**:
  - t(9;22) BCR-ABL1 fusion defines chronic myeloid leukemia
  - t(15;17) PML-RARA fusion defines acute promyelocytic leukemia
  - t(11;14) CCND1-IGH fusion is characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma
  - t(8;14) MYC-IGH fusion is found in Burkitt lymphoma

- **Solid tumors**:
  - t(X;18) SS18-SSX fusion is diagnostic of synovial sarcoma
  - t(11;22) EWSR1-FLI1 fusion defines Ewing sarcoma
  - t(12;15) ETV6-NTRK3 fusion is found in infantile fibrosarcoma
  - Der(17)t(X;17) ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion is characteristic of alveolar soft part sarcoma

These chromosomal abnormalities often define specific disease entities in the World Health Organization classification systems.

**Prognostic Significance**

Chromosomal abnormalities provide important prognostic information in many cancers:

- **Favorable prognosis**:
  - t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17) in acute myeloid leukemia
  - Hyperdiploidy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  - t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia

- **Adverse prognosis**:
  - Complex karyotype (≥3 chromosomal abnormalities) in many hematologic malignancies
  - 17p deletion (involving TP53) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers
  - Monosomy 7 or deletion 7q in myeloid neoplasms
  - Isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma

Chromosomal abnormalities are integrated into prognostic scoring systems for various cancers, guiding treatment intensity and approach.

**Therapeutic Implications**

Chromosomal abnormalities can guide treatment selection and predict therapeutic response:

- **Targeted therapies**:
  - BCR-ABL1 fusions: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib)
  - ALK rearrangements in lung cancer: ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, lorlatinib)
  - ROS1 rearrangements in lung cancer: ROS1 inhibitors (crizotinib, entrectinib)
  - NTRK fusions: TRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib)
  - HER2 amplification: Anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1)

- **Conventional therapies**:
  - PML-RARA fusion: All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide
  - MLL rearrangements: Intensive chemotherapy approaches
  - Certain chromosomal abnormalities may predict sensitivity or resistance to specific chemotherapy agents

- **Emerging approaches**:
  - Homologous recombination deficiency (often involving chromosomal rearrangements): PARP inhibitors
  - Chromothripsis and high levels of genomic instability: Potential immunotherapy responsiveness

The identification of chromosomal abnormalities has transformed cancer therapy, enabling precision medicine approaches tailored to the specific genetic alterations driving each patient's cancer.

## 4.4 DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Failure in Cancer

The integrity of the human genome is constantly threatened by both endogenous processes and exogenous agents. DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to detect and correct these damages, maintaining genomic stability. Defects in these repair pathways contribute significantly to carcinogenesis by allowing the accumulation of mutations and chromosomal aberrations.

### 4.4.1 Overview of DNA Damage and Repair

DNA damage occurs continuously in human cells through various mechanisms, requiring robust repair systems to prevent mutation accumulation.

**Types of DNA Damage**

Human DNA is subject to multiple forms of damage:

- **Base modifications**:
  - **Oxidation**: Formation of 8-oxoguanine and other oxidized bases from reactive oxygen species
  - **Alkylation**: Addition of alkyl groups to bases from endogenous S-adenosylmethionine or exogenous alkylating agents
  - **Deamination**: Loss of amino groups, e.g., cytosine to uracil, adenine to hypoxanthine

- **Abasic sites**: Loss of bases, primarily through spontaneous depurination

- **Bulky adducts**: Large chemical groups attached to bases from UV radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.

- **Crosslinks**:
  - **Intrastrand crosslinks**: Between bases on the same DNA strand
  - **Interstrand crosslinks**: Between bases on opposite DNA strands
  - **DNA-protein crosslinks**: Between DNA and proteins

- **Strand breaks**:
  - **Single-strand breaks (SSBs)**: Breaks in one strand of the DNA double helix
  - **Double-strand breaks (DSBs)**: Breaks in both strands, particularly dangerous

It is estimated that each human cell experiences approximately 70,000 DNA lesions per day, highlighting the critical importance of DNA repair mechanisms.

**General Principles of DNA Repair**

Despite the diversity of DNA repair pathways, several common principles apply:

1. **Damage recognition**: Specialized proteins detect the presence of DNA damage
2. **Damage removal**: The damaged portion of DNA is excised or modified
3. **DNA synthesis**: The correct sequence is restored using the undamaged strand as a template
4. **Ligation**: The final nick in the DNA backbone is sealed

DNA repair is integrated with other cellular processes through:
- Cell cycle checkpoints that arrest cell division until repair is complete
- Chromatin remodeling to provide access to damaged DNA
- Transcriptional responses that upregulate repair proteins
- Post-translational modifications that regulate repair protein activity

When damage is too extensive for repair, cells may trigger apoptosis to prevent the propagation of mutations.

### 4.4.2 Major DNA Repair Pathways

Multiple specialized repair pathways have evolved to address different types of DNA damage.

**Base Excision Repair (BER)**

BER removes damaged bases that cause relatively minor distortions to the DNA helix:

1. **Recognition and excision**: DNA glycosylases recognize and remove specific damaged bases, creating an abasic site
2. **Abasic site processing**: AP endonuclease (APE1) cleaves the DNA backbone at the abasic site
3. **End processing**: Various enzymes process the DNA ends to prepare for synthesis
4. **DNA synthesis and ligation**: DNA polymerase β fills the gap, and DNA ligase seals the nick

BER operates through two sub-pathways:
- **Short-patch BER**: Replaces a single nucleotide
- **Long-patch BER**: Replaces 2-10 nucleotides

Key proteins in BER include:
- DNA glycosylases (e.g., OGG1, UNG, MUTYH)
- APE1
- DNA polymerase β
- XRCC1
- DNA ligase III

BER is the primary pathway for repairing oxidative DNA damage, which is particularly relevant in cancer due to elevated reactive oxygen species in many tumor types.

**Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**

NER removes bulky DNA lesions that distort the DNA helix:

1. **Damage recognition**:
   - **Global genomic NER (GG-NER)**: Surveys the entire genome
   - **Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER)**: Focuses on damage in actively transcribed genes
2. **DNA unwinding**: Helicases open the DNA around the damage
3. **Dual incision**: Endonucleases cut the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion
4. **Excision**: Removal of a 24-32 nucleotide fragment containing the damage
5. **DNA synthesis and ligation**: DNA polymerases fill the gap, and DNA ligase seals the nick

Key proteins in NER include:
- XPC, DDB1, DDB2 (GG-NER recognition)
- CSA, CSB (TC-NER recognition)
- TFIIH complex (including XPB, XPD)
- XPA, RPA (verification)
- XPG, XPF-ERCC1 (incision)
- DNA polymerases δ, ε, κ
- DNA ligase I

Defects in NER cause xeroderma pigmentosum, a syndrome characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and a ~10,000-fold increased risk of skin cancer, highlighting the pathway's importance in preventing UV-induced carcinogenesis.

**Mismatch Repair (MMR)**

MMR corrects base-base mismatches and insertion/deletion loops that arise during DNA replication:

1. **Mismatch recognition**: MutS homologs (MSH2-MSH6 or MSH2-MSH3) recognize mismatches or loops
2. **Recruitment of repair machinery**: MutL homologs (MLH1-PMS2, MLH1-PMS1, or MLH1-MLH3) and other proteins assemble
3. **Strand discrimination**: The newly synthesized strand (containing the error) is identified
4. **Excision**: Exonucleases remove a segment of the newly synthesized strand containing the mismatch
5. **Resynthesis and ligation**: DNA polymerase fills the gap, and DNA ligase seals the nick

Key proteins in MMR include:
- MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 (recognition)
- MLH1, PMS2, PMS1, MLH3 (coordination)
- EXO1 (excision)
- PCNA (strand discrimination)
- DNA polymerase δ
- DNA ligase I

Germline mutations in MMR genes cause Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), characterized by increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers. Somatic inactivation of MMR occurs in ~15% of colorectal cancers and various other tumor types, leading to microsatellite instability (MSI) and hypermutation.

**Double-Strand Break Repair**

DSBs are repaired through two main pathways:

**Homologous Recombination (HR)**:
1. **End resection**: The 5' ends of the break are degraded, creating 3' single-stranded overhangs
2. **Strand invasion**: The 3' overhang invades a homologous sequence (usually the sister chromatid)
3. **DNA synthesis**: The invading strand is extended using the homologous sequence as a template
4. **Resolution**: The resulting structure is resolved, completing repair

Key proteins in HR include:
- MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50, NBS1)
- CtIP
- BRCA1, BRCA2
- RAD51 and its paralogs
- PALB2
- BLM, WRN helicases

HR is most active in S and G2 phases when a sister chromatid is available as a template, and it provides high-fidelity repair.

**Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**:
1. **End binding**: Ku70/80 heterodimer binds the broken DNA ends
2. **End processing**: Various enzymes modify the ends to make them compatible for ligation
3. **Ligation**: DNA ligase IV seals the break

Key proteins in NHEJ include:
- Ku70/80
- DNA-PKcs
- Artemis
- XRCC4
- XLF
- DNA ligase IV

NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle and is the predominant DSB repair pathway in G1. It is more error-prone than HR, particularly when end processing is required.

**Alternative end joining (alt-EJ)** pathways, including microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), operate when canonical pathways fail and are typically more mutagenic.

Defects in DSB repair are strongly associated with cancer predisposition. Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, while defects in other HR genes are associated with various cancer predisposition syndromes.

**Direct Reversal Repair**

Some DNA damages can be directly reversed without breaking the DNA backbone:

- **O⁶-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT)**: Removes alkyl groups from the O⁶ position of guanine, transferring them to a cysteine residue in its active site (suicide enzyme)
- **AlkB homologs (ALKBH2, ALKBH3)**: Remove certain alkyl groups through oxidative demethylation
- **Photolyases**: Directly reverse UV-induced pyrimidine dimers using blue light energy (not present in placental mammals)

These mechanisms are simpler than excision repair but are limited to specific types of damage.

**Fanconi Anemia Pathway**

The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway specifically addresses DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs):

1. **Crosslink recognition**: FANCM and associated proteins detect the ICL
2. **FANCD2-FANCI ubiquitination**: The FA core complex ubiquitinates the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer
3. **Crosslink unhooking**: Nucleases incise the DNA on both sides of the crosslink
4. **Translesion synthesis**: Specialized polymerases bypass the unhooked crosslink
5. **Homologous recombination**: Completes the repair

Germline mutations in FA genes cause Fanconi anemia, characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition, particularly to acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinomas.

### 4.4.3 DNA Repair Defects in Cancer

Defects in DNA repair pathways are common in cancer and contribute to both cancer initiation and progression.

**Inherited DNA Repair Defects and Cancer Predisposition**

Multiple cancer predisposition syndromes result from germline mutations in DNA repair genes:

- **Lynch syndrome**: Mutations in MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2)
  - Increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, gastric, and other cancers
  - Tumors exhibit microsatellite instability and hypermutation

- **Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome**: Mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2
  - High risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers
  - Defective homologous recombination repair

- **Li-Fraumeni syndrome**: TP53 mutations
  - Predisposition to multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, sarcomas, brain tumors
  - Defects in DNA damage response and apoptosis

- **Xeroderma pigmentosum**: Mutations in NER genes (XPA-XPG)
  - Extreme sensitivity to UV radiation
  - Very high risk of skin cancers

- **Ataxia-telangiectasia**: Mutations in ATM
  - Defective DNA damage response signaling
  - Increased risk of lymphomas and leukemias

- **Fanconi anemia**: Mutations in FA genes
  - Defective interstrand crosslink repair
  - Predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia and solid tumors

- **MUTYH-associated polyposis**: Biallelic MUTYH mutations
  - Defective base excision repair
  - Increased risk of colorectal cancer

These syndromes illustrate the critical role of DNA repair in preventing carcinogenesis and have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cancer development.

**Somatic Alterations in DNA Repair Genes**

Beyond inherited syndromes, somatic alterations in DNA repair genes are common in sporadic cancers:

- **MMR deficiency**: Occurs in ~15% of colorectal cancers, often through MLH1 promoter methylation
- **BRCA1/2 inactivation**: Found in a subset of sporadic breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers
- **MGMT silencing**: Common in glioblastoma, typically through promoter methylation
- **TP53 mutations**: Present in approximately 50% of all cancers, affecting DNA damage responses
- **ATM inactivation**: Frequent in mantle cell lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, and other tumor types
- **PARP1 alterations**: Amplification or overexpression in various cancers, potentially promoting base excision repair

These alterations can drive genomic instability and mutagenesis, facilitating cancer progression.

**Mutational Signatures of DNA Repair Deficiency**

DNA repair deficiencies leave characteristic mutational patterns that can be detected through genome sequencing:

- **MMR deficiency**: High mutation burden with microsatellite instability and increased small insertions/deletions at repetitive sequences (Signatures 6, 15, 20, 26)
- **HR deficiency**: Characteristic pattern of small deletions with microhomology at breakpoints and large-scale structural rearrangements (Signature 3)
- **NER deficiency**: UV-induced C>T transitions at dipyrimidine sites in skin cancers (Signature 7)
- **POLE/POLD1 mutations**: Extremely high mutation burden with C>A transversions in specific contexts (Signatures 10, 14)
- **APOBEC mutagenesis**: C>T and C>G mutations in specific sequence contexts, often increased when DNA repair is compromised (Signatures 2, 13)

These signatures serve as biomarkers of repair deficiency and can guide therapeutic decisions.

**Therapeutic Targeting of DNA Repair Defects**

DNA repair deficiencies create vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited:

- **PARP inhibitors**: Synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cancers (BRCA1/2 mutated)
  - Olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib, talazoparib
  - Approved for breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers with HR deficiency

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**: High efficacy in MMR-deficient/MSI-high tumors
  - Pembrolizumab, nivolumab
  - Approved for MMR-deficient/MSI-high tumors regardless of tumor type

- **Alkylating agents**: Enhanced efficacy in MGMT-deficient tumors
  - Temozolomide in glioblastoma
  - MGMT promoter methylation as a predictive biomarker

- **Platinum compounds**: Particularly effective in HR-deficient and FA pathway-deficient tumors
  - Cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin
  - Standard therapy for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer

- **ATR and CHK1 inhibitors**: Synthetic lethality in cancers with specific repair defects
  - Under clinical development
  - Potential for combination with DNA-damaging agents

These therapeutic approaches transform repair deficiencies from drivers of carcinogenesis into targetable vulnerabilities, exemplifying the concept of synthetic lethality in cancer therapy.

### 4.4.4 DNA Damage Response Signaling

Beyond repair pathways, cells possess sophisticated signaling networks that detect DNA damage and coordinate cellular responses.

**Sensors of DNA Damage**

Various proteins detect different types of DNA damage:

- **MRN complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1)**: Recognizes DNA double-strand breaks
- **RPA (Replication Protein A)**: Binds single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks
- **PARP1/2 (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase)**: Detects single-strand breaks
- **Ku70/80**: Binds double-strand break ends
- **XPC, DDB1/2**: Recognize bulky DNA lesions
- **MSH2-MSH6, MSH2-MSH3**: Detect mismatches and insertion/deletion loops

These sensors trigger the activation of downstream signaling pathways.

**Transducers and Mediators**

DNA damage signals are amplified and transmitted by kinase cascades:

- **ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated)**: Primarily activated by double-strand breaks
  - Phosphorylates numerous substrates, including CHK2, p53, and H2AX
  - Coordinates double-strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis

- **ATR (ATM and Rad3-related)**: Responds to single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks
  - Phosphorylates substrates including CHK1, p53, and RPA
  - Critical for replication stress responses

- **DNA-PK (DNA-dependent Protein Kinase)**: Activated by double-strand breaks
  - Primarily regulates non-homologous end joining
  - Also participates in broader damage responses

- **Mediator proteins**: Amplify and specify the damage signal
  - 53BP1, BRCA1, MDC1, TOPBP1
  - Influence pathway choice and repair fidelity

These transducers create a phosphorylation cascade that amplifies the initial damage signal.

**Effectors and Cellular Outcomes**

The DNA damage response leads to various cellular outcomes:

- **Cell cycle arrest**:
  - **G1/S checkpoint**: Prevents replication of damaged DNA
  - **Intra-S checkpoint**: Slows ongoing replication
  - **G2/M checkpoint**: Prevents segregation of damaged chromosomes
  - Key effectors include p53, p21, CDC25 phosphatases

- **DNA repair**: Activation and recruitment of appropriate repair pathways

- **Transcriptional programs**: Upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis

- **Apoptosis**: Elimination of cells with irreparable damage
  - p53-dependent and independent pathways
  - Balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors

- **Senescence**: Permanent cell cycle arrest
  - Particularly in response to telomere dysfunction or oncogenic stress
  - Characterized by specific gene expression changes and secretory phenotype

- **Chromatin remodeling**: Changes in chromatin structure to facilitate repair and signaling

The choice between these outcomes depends on cell type, damage type and extent, cell cycle phase, and tissue context.

**DNA Damage Response in Cancer**

Alterations in DNA damage response signaling are common in cancer:

- **TP53 mutations**: Present in ~50% of cancers, compromising multiple damage responses
- **ATM/ATR pathway defects**: Impair damage detection and checkpoint activation
- **BRCA1/MDC1/53BP1 alterations**: Affect repair pathway choice and efficiency
- **Checkpoint override**: Through cyclin/CDK overexpression or CDC25 phosphatase dysregulation
- **Apoptotic defects**: Upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL2, MCL1) or downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX, PUMA)

These alterations can both promote carcinogenesis (by allowing cells with DNA damage to survive and proliferate) and create vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically targeted (through synthetic lethal approaches).

## 4.5 Genomic Instability

Genomic instability—the tendency to acquire genetic alterations at an accelerated rate—is a hallmark of cancer that enables the acquisition of other cancer hallmarks by generating genetic diversity within tumor cell populations. This section explores the forms, causes, and consequences of genomic instability in cancer.

### 4.5.1 Forms of Genomic Instability

Genomic instability in cancer manifests in several distinct forms, often coexisting within the same tumor.

**Chromosomal Instability (CIN)**

CIN involves ongoing changes in chromosome structure and number:

- **Numerical CIN**: Frequent gains and losses of whole chromosomes during cell division
  - Results in aneuploidy and intercellular heterogeneity
  - Caused by defects in mitotic checkpoint, chromosome cohesion, or spindle assembly

- **Structural CIN**: Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements
  - Translocations, inversions, deletions, amplifications
  - Often reflects defects in DNA repair, particularly double-strand break repair

CIN is the most common form of genomic instability, present in approximately 85% of non-hematological cancers, and is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis.

**
