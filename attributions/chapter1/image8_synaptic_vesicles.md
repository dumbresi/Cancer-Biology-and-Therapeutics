Title: 6992: Molecular view of glutamatergic synapse
Description:This illustration highlights spherical pre-synaptic vesicles that carry the neurotransmitter glutamate. The presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are shown with proteins relevant for transmitting and modulating the neuronal signal.  PDB 101â€™s Opioids and Pain Signaling video explains how glutamatergic synapses are involved in the process of pain signaling.
