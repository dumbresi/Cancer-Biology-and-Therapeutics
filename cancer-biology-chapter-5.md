# Chapter 5: Oncogenes

## 5.1 Discovery of Oncogenes

The discovery of oncogenes represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in cancer biology, transforming our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. This conceptual revolution began with research on tumor viruses and eventually led to the identification of human genes capable of driving malignant transformation when altered.

### 5.1.1 Viral Oncogenes and the Birth of Oncogene Theory

The study of oncogenes originated from investigations into tumor-causing viruses, particularly retroviruses, in animal models during the early to mid-20th century.

**Peyton Rous and the Discovery of Tumor Viruses**

In 1911, Peyton Rous made a groundbreaking discovery at the Rockefeller Institute. He found that cell-free filtrates from chicken sarcomas could transmit cancer to healthy chickens, demonstrating that a submicroscopic agent—later identified as a virus—could cause cancer. This virus was subsequently named Rous sarcoma virus (RSV).

Despite the significance of this finding, the concept that viruses could cause cancer remained controversial for decades. It wasn't until the 1950s and 1960s that renewed interest in tumor viruses emerged, facilitated by advances in tissue culture techniques and molecular biology.

**Transformation Assays and src**

A key advance came in the 1970s when transformation assays were developed to study the cancer-causing ability of viruses in cell culture. These assays revealed that RSV could transform cultured fibroblasts, causing them to display cancerous properties including:
- Loss of contact inhibition
- Anchorage-independent growth
- Altered morphology
- Increased glucose uptake
- Chromosomal abnormalities

In 1970, G. Steven Martin identified a mutant of RSV that could replicate but not transform cells. This temperature-sensitive mutant enabled the identification of a specific viral gene, named src (pronounced "sarc"), as the cancer-causing element of RSV. The src gene was not required for viral replication but was essential for cellular transformation, establishing the concept of a viral oncogene.

**Discovery of Cellular Origins of Viral Oncogenes**

The truly revolutionary insight came in 1976 when J. Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus, working at the University of California, San Francisco, discovered that the viral src gene (v-src) had a cellular counterpart in normal chicken DNA. Using molecular hybridization techniques, they demonstrated that v-src was not truly a viral gene but rather a captured and altered version of a normal cellular gene (later termed c-src or cellular src).

This paradigm-shifting discovery, for which Bishop and Varmus received the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, revealed that:
1. Cancer-causing genes were present in the normal cellular genome
2. These normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) could be activated or altered to become oncogenes
3. Retroviruses could capture these cellular genes during infection and incorporate them into their genomes, often in modified forms

The discovery of the cellular origin of viral oncogenes led to a fundamental reconceptualization of cancer as a disease of altered cellular genes rather than one necessarily caused by external agents.

### 5.1.2 From Animal Models to Human Cancer

While the viral oncogene work provided crucial insights, it remained unclear whether similar mechanisms operated in human cancers, which are rarely caused by retroviruses.

**DNA Transfection Experiments**

A breakthrough in connecting oncogene theory to human cancer came in the late 1970s and early 1980s through DNA transfection experiments. Robert Weinberg, Michael Wigler, and Geoffrey Cooper independently demonstrated that DNA extracted from human cancer cells could transform mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts in culture, conferring cancer-like properties.

This transforming activity suggested that human cancer cells contained genetic elements similar to viral oncogenes. Through cycles of transfection and tumorigenicity assays, researchers isolated and characterized the first human oncogene from a bladder carcinoma cell line.

**Identification of RAS as a Human Oncogene**

In 1982, three laboratories—those of Robert Weinberg, Michael Wigler, and Mariano Barbacid—simultaneously identified the transforming gene from human bladder cancer as a mutated version of the HRAS gene. This was the first demonstration of an activated oncogene in a human tumor.

The HRAS oncogene differed from its normal counterpart by a single nucleotide change, resulting in an amino acid substitution (glycine to valine) at position 12 of the protein. This subtle change was sufficient to confer transforming activity, illustrating how point mutations could convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes.

Soon after, related oncogenes KRAS and NRAS were identified in other human tumors, establishing the RAS family as critical human oncogenes.

**Chromosomal Translocations and Oncogenes**

Another key advancement came from studying chromosomal abnormalities in human cancers, particularly in leukemias and lymphomas. In 1982, the discovery that the Philadelphia chromosome—a consistent chromosomal translocation in chronic myeloid leukemia—created a fusion between the BCR and ABL genes provided evidence for a second mechanism of oncogene activation in human cancer.

Subsequently, numerous other chromosomal translocations were identified that either:
- Created fusion oncogenes (e.g., BCR-ABL, EWS-FLI1)
- Placed proto-oncogenes under the control of strong promoters/enhancers (e.g., MYC translocations in Burkitt lymphoma)

These findings established chromosomal rearrangements as important mechanisms for oncogene activation in human malignancies.

### 5.1.3 From Single Oncogenes to Cooperation

As oncogene research progressed, it became clear that transformation often required multiple genetic alterations rather than a single oncogene.

**Oncogene Cooperation**

In 1983, experiments by Earl Ruley and subsequently Robert Weinberg's group demonstrated that combinations of oncogenes were more effective at transforming primary cells than single oncogenes. For example, while RAS alone could not efficiently transform primary rodent fibroblasts, the combination of RAS with MYC could.

This concept of "oncogene cooperation" suggested that different oncogenes contributed distinct capabilities to the transformed phenotype. Some oncogenes (like MYC) primarily drove proliferation while others (like RAS) provided additional signals for transformation.

**Multi-step Carcinogenesis Models**

The oncogene cooperation concept aligned with epidemiological data suggesting that cancer development involved multiple sequential steps. This led to the development of multi-step carcinogenesis models, exemplified by the genetic progression model for colorectal cancer proposed by Bert Vogelstein and colleagues in the late 1980s.

These models integrated the roles of both oncogenes (like KRAS) and tumor suppressor genes (like APC and TP53), providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding cancer development at the molecular level.

### 5.1.4 Modern Oncogene Discovery

Advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized oncogene discovery, moving from candidate gene approaches to comprehensive genome-wide analyses.

**High-throughput Sequencing Approaches**

The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies in the early 2000s enabled systematic characterization of cancer genomes. Large-scale initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have cataloged genetic alterations across thousands of tumors spanning dozens of cancer types.

These efforts have:
- Identified numerous previously unknown oncogenes
- Revealed the frequency and distribution of oncogenic alterations across cancer types
- Uncovered new mechanisms of oncogene activation, including non-coding mutations and epigenetic alterations
- Enabled the identification of "driver" mutations that promote carcinogenesis among the many "passenger" mutations present in cancer genomes

**Functional Genomics Screens**

Complementing sequence-based approaches, functional genomics screens using RNA interference (RNAi) or CRISPR-Cas9 technology have enabled the systematic identification of genes essential for cancer cell survival or growth.

These approaches have:
- Identified oncogenes that cancer cells depend on for survival (oncogene addiction)
- Revealed synthetic lethal interactions with known oncogenes
- Identified context-specific oncogene functions that depend on tissue type or co-occurring mutations

The integration of genomic and functional approaches has vastly expanded our catalog of oncogenes and deepened our understanding of their roles in different cancer contexts.

## 5.2 Proto-oncogenes: Normal Cellular Counterparts

The discovery that oncogenes derived from normal cellular genes (proto-oncogenes) raised fundamental questions about the physiological functions of these genes and how their normal regulatory controls are subverted in cancer. Understanding proto-oncogenes provides critical insights into both normal cellular processes and the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation.

### 5.2.1 Physiological Functions of Proto-oncogenes

Proto-oncogenes encode proteins with essential roles in normal cellular processes, particularly those involved in growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

**Cell Cycle Regulation**

Many proto-oncogenes encode proteins that regulate progression through the cell cycle:

- **Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)**: Control cell cycle transitions
  - Cyclin D1 (CCND1) promotes G1 to S transition
  - CDK4 partners with cyclin D to phosphorylate RB protein

- **Transcription factors**: Regulate expression of cell cycle genes
  - MYC activates genes required for G1 to S transition
  - E2F family members regulate S-phase entry

These cell cycle regulators ensure that proliferation occurs only under appropriate conditions, such as in response to growth factor stimulation or during development and tissue regeneration.

**Signal Transduction**

Proto-oncogenes are prominent components of signaling pathways that transmit external cues to the cellular machinery:

- **Growth factor receptors**: Membrane proteins that sense extracellular growth factors
  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) responds to EGF and related ligands
  - HER2/ERBB2 forms heterodimers with other ERBB family receptors

- **Signal transducers**: Proteins that relay signals from receptors to downstream effectors
  - RAS proteins function as molecular switches linking receptor activation to various effector pathways
  - ABL kinases transduce signals affecting cytoskeletal organization and DNA damage responses

- **Second messenger regulators**: Control intracellular signaling molecules
  - Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)
  - Phospholipase C isoforms generate diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate

These signaling proteins ensure that cells respond appropriately to their microenvironment, proliferating when stimulated by growth factors and ceasing proliferation when signals are withdrawn.

**Transcriptional Regulation**

Many proto-oncogenes encode transcription factors that control gene expression programs:

- **MYC**: Regulates expression of genes involved in cell growth, metabolism, and ribosome biogenesis
- **JUN and FOS**: Form the AP-1 complex that regulates genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis
- **ETS family**: Controls genes involved in development, differentiation, and angiogenesis

These transcription factors integrate multiple signals to coordinate complex cellular responses by modulating the expression of target gene networks.

**Apoptosis Regulation**

Some proto-oncogenes encode proteins that regulate programmed cell death:

- **BCL2 family**: Includes both pro-survival (e.g., BCL2, BCL-XL) and pro-apoptotic (e.g., BAX, BAK) members
- **AKT**: Promotes cell survival by inhibiting pro-apoptotic factors

The balance between survival and apoptotic signals ensures that damaged or abnormal cells are eliminated while healthy cells are preserved.

**Cellular Differentiation**

Proto-oncogenes play crucial roles in cellular differentiation programs:

- **WNT signaling components**: Control cell fate decisions during development and tissue homeostasis
- **Notch pathway proteins**: Regulate binary cell fate decisions and maintain stem cell populations
- **Nuclear receptors**: Mediate responses to hormones and other ligands that influence differentiation

These differentiation regulators ensure that cells acquire the appropriate specialized functions based on developmental and microenvironmental cues.

### 5.2.2 Cellular Localization and Biochemical Activities

Proto-oncogenes encode proteins that function at various cellular locations and possess diverse biochemical activities.

**Membrane-Associated Proteins**

The plasma membrane serves as a critical interface between the cell and its environment, hosting numerous proto-oncogene products:

- **Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)**: Transmembrane proteins with extracellular ligand-binding domains and intracellular kinase domains
  - EGFR, HER2, PDGFR, FGFR, MET, KIT
  - Activate multiple downstream pathways through tyrosine phosphorylation

- **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)**: Seven-transmembrane domain receptors that activate heterotrimeric G proteins
  - Smoothened (SMO) in Hedgehog signaling
  - Certain chemokine and hormone receptors

- **Membrane-associated GTPases**: Function as molecular switches
  - RAS family proteins (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS) cycle between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states
  - Require lipid modifications (farnesylation, geranylgeranylation) for membrane association

These membrane proteins sense extracellular signals and initiate intracellular signaling cascades, controlling the cell's response to its environment.

**Cytoplasmic Signaling Proteins**

The cytoplasm contains numerous proto-oncogene products involved in signal relay:

- **Protein kinases**: Catalyze the phosphorylation of specific substrates
  - Serine/threonine kinases (e.g., BRAF, AKT, mTOR)
  - Tyrosine kinases (e.g., ABL, SRC, JAK)
  - Dual-specificity kinases (e.g., MEK)

- **Adaptor proteins**: Facilitate protein-protein interactions in signaling complexes
  - GRB2 links activated RTKs to the RAS pathway
  - SHC connects various receptors to multiple downstream pathways

- **Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)**: Activate small GTPases by promoting GDP-GTP exchange
  - SOS activates RAS proteins
  - VAV activates RAC and other Rho family GTPases

- **GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)**: Inactivate small GTPases by enhancing their intrinsic GTP hydrolysis
  - NF1 negatively regulates RAS activity
  - BCR regulates multiple small GTPases

These cytoplasmic proteins form complex networks that process, amplify, and integrate signals from various sources.

**Nuclear Proteins**

The nucleus houses proto-oncogene products that directly regulate gene expression:

- **Transcription factors**: Bind specific DNA sequences to regulate gene transcription
  - MYC, FOS, JUN, ETS family members
  - Often function as dimers or larger complexes

  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)
  - ABL1 in response to DNA damage

These nuclear proteins control gene expression programs that determine cellular phenotype and behavior.

**Biochemical Activities**

Proto-oncogene products possess various enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities:

- **Kinase activity**: Phosphorylation of proteins or lipids
  - Tyrosine kinases (EGFR, ABL, SRC)
  - Serine/threonine kinases (RAF, AKT)
  - Lipid kinases (PI3K)

- **GTPase activity**: Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP
  - RAS family proteins
  - Rho family proteins

- **Transcriptional activation/repression**: Modulation of gene expression
  - MYC, JUN, FOS
  - Nuclear receptors

- **Scaffold/adaptor functions**: Organization of protein complexes
  - KSR in the MAPK pathway
  - Various adaptor proteins containing SH2, SH3, or PTB domains

These diverse biochemical activities enable proto-oncogene products to fulfill their normal cellular functions.

### 5.2.3 Regulation of Proto-oncogene Expression and Activity

Given their potent effects on cellular processes, proto-oncogene expression and activity are tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms.

**Transcriptional Regulation**

The expression of proto-oncogenes is carefully controlled at the transcriptional level:

- **Tissue-specific expression**: Many proto-oncogenes show restricted expression patterns
  - KIT in hematopoietic stem cells, melanocytes, and germ cells
  - RET in neural crest derivatives and developing kidney

- **Developmental regulation**: Expression that varies with developmental stage
  - MYC during embryogenesis and tissue regeneration
  - WNT pathway components during organogenesis

- **Microenvironmental responsiveness**: Induction by extracellular signals
  - FOS and JUN as immediate-early genes induced by growth factors
  - Cyclin D1 in response to mitogenic stimulation

- **Feedback mechanisms**: Self-limiting expression patterns
  - RAS activation induces expression of RAS GAPs
  - MYC induces negative regulators of its own activity

These transcriptional controls ensure that proto-oncogenes are expressed at appropriate levels and in the correct cellular contexts.

**Post-transcriptional Regulation**

Proto-oncogene expression is further regulated post-transcriptionally:

- **mRNA stability**: Control of transcript half-life
  - AU-rich elements in 3' UTRs of many proto-oncogene mRNAs (e.g., FOS, MYC) target them for rapid degradation
  - microRNAs regulate translation and stability of proto-oncogene transcripts

- **Alternative splicing**: Generation of protein isoforms with different functions
  - BCL2 family members with pro- or anti-apoptotic activities
  - RTKs with altered ligand specificities or constitutive activity

- **Translational control**: Regulation of protein synthesis
  - mTOR signaling controls translation of mRNAs with complex 5' UTRs, including those encoding cell cycle regulators

These post-transcriptional mechanisms provide additional layers of control over proto-oncogene expression.

**Post-translational Regulation**

The activity of proto-oncogene products is often regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions:

- **Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation**: Reversible modification affecting protein activity
  - RTK autophosphorylation upon ligand binding
  - RAF activation through phosphorylation by RAS and other kinases
  - Inactivation by specific phosphatases

- **Protein-protein interactions**: Modulation through binding partners
  - MYC activity regulated by MAX dimerization
  - RAS interactions with effectors controlled by GTP binding

- **Protein stability**: Control of protein half-life
  - MYC degradation regulated by phosphorylation
  - Cyclin levels controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis

- **Subcellular localization**: Compartmentalization of activity
  - Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors
  - Membrane recruitment of signaling proteins

- **Conformational changes**: Alterations in protein structure affecting function
  - RTK dimerization and conformational changes upon ligand binding
  - RAS conformational switch between GDP- and GTP-bound states

These post-translational regulatory mechanisms ensure that proto-oncogene products are active only under appropriate conditions and for limited durations.

### 5.2.4 Proto-oncogenes in Development and Tissue Homeostasis

Proto-oncogenes play essential roles during embryonic development and in maintaining adult tissue homeostasis.

**Embryonic Development**

Proto-oncogenes are critical for various aspects of embryogenesis:

- **Cell proliferation**: Controlled expansion of cell populations
  - MYC essential for embryonic growth and organogenesis
  - RAS pathway components required for normal development

- **Morphogenesis**: Formation of tissues and organs
  - WNT signaling in axis formation and organ development
  - FGF receptors in limb development

- **Cell migration**: Movement of cells to appropriate locations
  - MET in migration of muscle precursor cells
  - PDGF signaling in neural crest cell migration

- **Cell fate determination**: Specification of cell lineages
  - Notch signaling in neurogenesis and other binary cell fate decisions
  - KIT in melanocyte, hematopoietic, and germ cell development

The essential developmental functions of many proto-oncogenes explain why their complete loss often results in embryonic lethality in knockout models.

**Adult Tissue Homeostasis**

In adult organisms, proto-oncogenes contribute to tissue maintenance and regeneration:

- **Stem cell regulation**: Maintenance of adult stem cell populations
  - WNT signaling in intestinal stem cell self-renewal
  - Notch signaling in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance

- **Controlled proliferation**: Replacement of cells lost to normal turnover
  - EGFR signaling in epithelial renewal
  - PDGF signaling in fibroblast proliferation

- **Tissue regeneration**: Response to injury
  - MYC activation during liver regeneration
  - FGF signaling in wound healing

- **Immune regulation**: Control of immune cell proliferation and function
  - JAK-STAT signaling in cytokine responses
  - RAS pathway in T cell activation

The involvement of proto-oncogenes in these processes highlights the fine balance between normal tissue maintenance and the risk of cancer when these genes are dysregulated.

## 5.3 Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation

The conversion of proto-oncogenes to oncogenes occurs through various genetic and epigenetic alterations that result in increased activity or expression of the encoded proteins. These alterations disrupt the normal regulatory controls that limit proto-oncogene function, leading to constitutive or inappropriate activation that drives cancer development.

### 5.3.1 Point Mutations

Point mutations—changes in single nucleotides—represent a common mechanism of oncogene activation, particularly for genes encoding signaling proteins.

**Activating Mutations in Protein Coding Regions**

Specific point mutations can alter protein function to promote oncogenic activity:

- **RAS mutations**: Glycine-to-valine (G12V), glycine-to-aspartate (G12D), or glycine-to-cysteine (G12C) substitutions in codons 12, 13, or 61 impair intrinsic GTPase activity and interaction with GAPs, locking RAS in its active, GTP-bound state
  - KRAS mutations in pancreatic (90%), colorectal (40%), and lung adenocarcinoma (30%)
  - NRAS mutations in melanoma (20%) and acute myeloid leukemia (15%)

- **BRAF mutations**: Valine-to-glutamate substitution at codon 600 (V600E) mimics phosphorylation of the activation segment, leading to constitutive kinase activity
  - Present in melanoma (50%), papillary thyroid carcinoma (40%), and colorectal cancer (10%)

- **Receptor tyrosine kinase mutations**: Various mutations affecting the kinase domain or regulatory regions
  - EGFR kinase domain mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletions) in lung adenocarcinoma
  - KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mastocytosis
  - FLT3 internal tandem duplications in acute myeloid leukemia

- **PI3K mutations**: Predominantly in the helical domain (E542K, E545K) or kinase domain (H1047R) of the catalytic subunit PIK3CA
  - Common in breast, endometrial, and colorectal cancers

These mutations typically affect key regulatory regions of the protein, disrupting autoinhibitory mechanisms or enhancing catalytic activity.

**Mutations in Regulatory Regions**

Point mutations can also alter gene expression by affecting non-coding regulatory elements:

- **Promoter mutations**: Create or destroy transcription factor binding sites
  - TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) in melanoma, glioblastoma, and other cancers create binding sites for ETS transcription factors, increasing telomerase expression
  - ESR1 promoter mutations in breast cancer affect estrogen receptor expression

- **Enhancer mutations**: Alter long-range regulatory elements
  - MYC enhancer mutations in multiple myeloma and other cancers
  - TAL1 enhancer mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia

- **5' UTR mutations**: Affect translation efficiency
  - Mutations creating upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that regulate translation of the main coding sequence
  - Mutations altering RNA secondary structure

- **3' UTR mutations**: Affect mRNA stability or microRNA binding
  - Mutations disrupting microRNA binding sites, increasing oncogene expression
  - Mutations affecting AU-rich elements that control mRNA stability

These regulatory region mutations highlight the importance of gene dosage in oncogene function, with even modest increases in expression of certain proto-oncogenes being sufficient to promote oncogenesis.

**Mutational Hotspots and Structural Insights**

Activating mutations often cluster at specific "hotspots" within oncogenes:

- **Functional domains**: Mutations affecting catalytic or regulatory domains
  - ATP-binding pockets of kinases
  - GTP-binding sites of GTPases

- **Protein-protein interaction interfaces**: Mutations affecting regulatory interactions
  - RAS interactions with GAPs
  - Receptor dimerization interfaces

Structural biology has provided insights into how these mutations promote oncogenic activity:
- Crystal structures of mutant proteins revealing conformational changes
- Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating altered protein behavior
- Structure-based drug design targeting specific mutant proteins (e.g., KRASG12C inhibitors)

The non-random distribution of activating mutations reflects functional constraints, with mutations selected during cancer evolution based on their ability to confer growth and survival advantages.

### 5.3.2 Gene Amplification

Gene amplification involves the increase in copy number of a genomic region containing an oncogene, leading to elevated expression levels.

**Mechanisms of Gene Amplification**

Several processes can generate gene amplification:

- **Double-minute chromosomes**: Extrachromosomal circular DNA fragments containing amplified genes
  - Arise through excision of genomic DNA, circularization, and autonomous replication
  - Lack centromeres and are unequally segregated during mitosis
  - Common mechanism for MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma

- **Homogeneously staining regions (HSRs)**: Expanded chromosomal regions lacking the normal banding pattern
  - Result from integration of amplified sequences into chromosomes
  - Often contain multiple copies of the amplified gene arranged in tandem
  - Observed with ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer

- **Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles**: Repeated chromosomal breakage and fusion events
  - Initiated by chromosomal breaks or telomere dysfunction
  - Sister chromatids fuse after replication, leading to bridges during anaphase
  - Subsequent breakage creates unequal distribution of genetic material
  - Associated with complex amplification patterns

- **Chromothripsis**: Catastrophic chromosomal shattering and reassembly
  - Single catastrophic event generating multiple chromosomal rearrangements
  - Can lead to oncogene amplification through reassembly of shattered fragments
  - Observed in various cancer types, including neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification

These mechanisms generate extra copies of oncogenes, leading to increased mRNA and protein levels that drive cancer progression.

**Commonly Amplified Oncogenes**

Gene amplification affects numerous oncogenes across various cancer types:

- **ERBB2 (HER2)**: Amplified in breast (20%), gastric (20%), and other cancers
  - Associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis
  - Targeted therapeutically with antibodies (trastuzumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors

- **EGFR**: Amplified in glioblastoma (40%), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (30%), and other cancers
  - Often accompanied by structural variants (e.g., EGFRvIII in glioblastoma)
  - Targeted with antibodies and small molecule inhibitors

- **MYC family**: Amplified in various cancers
  - MYC in breast cancer, lung cancer, and others
  - MYCN in neuroblastoma (25%), associated with poor prognosis
  - MYCL in small cell lung cancer

- **Cyclin genes**: Regulators of cell cycle progression
  - CCND1 (cyclin D1) in breast cancer, head and neck cancer
  - CCNE1 (cyclin E1) in ovarian cancer, associated with chemotherapy resistance

- **MDM2**: Negative regulator of p53
  - Amplified in sarcomas, glioblastoma
  - Leads to p53 degradation and inactivation

The level of amplification (copy number) often correlates with expression levels and can influence disease aggressiveness and therapeutic response.

**Clinical Significance of Gene Amplification**

Oncogene amplification has important clinical implications:

- **Diagnostic markers**: Identification of specific disease subtypes
  - HER2-positive breast cancer as a distinct clinical entity
  - MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma as a high-risk category

- **Prognostic indicators**: Association with disease outcomes
  - MYCN amplification predicting poor prognosis in neuroblastoma
  - CCNE1 amplification associated with chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer

- **Therapeutic targets**: Opportunities for targeted intervention
  - HER2-targeted therapies for HER2-amplified cancers
  - CDK4/6 inhibitors for tumors with amplification of the corresponding genomic region

- **Resistance mechanisms**: Amplification emerging during treatment
  - MET amplification as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors
  - BRAF amplification in resistance to BRAF inhibitors

Detection of gene amplification is now standard practice in the clinical management of several cancer types, guiding treatment decisions and prognostic assessment.

### 5.3.3 Chromosomal Rearrangements

Chromosomal rearrangements, particularly translocations, represent a major mechanism of oncogene activation, especially in hematologic malignancies and sarcomas.

**Oncogenic Fusion Proteins**

Chromosomal translocations can create chimeric genes encoding fusion proteins with oncogenic properties:

- **BCR-ABL1**: Result of t(9;22) translocation (Philadelphia chromosome)
  - Constitutively active tyrosine kinase driving chronic myeloid leukemia
  - Targeted therapeutically with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib)

- **EML4-ALK**: Inversion in chromosome 2 in lung adenocarcinoma
  - Constitutively active kinase due to dimerization mediated by the EML4 coiled-coil domain
  - Targeted with ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib)

- **EWSR1-FLI1**: Result of t(11;22) translocation in Ewing sarcoma
  - Aberrant transcription factor activating oncogenic gene expression programs
  - Defines Ewing sarcoma as a distinct entity

- **PML-RARA**: Result of t(15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia
  - Disrupts normal retinoic acid signaling and blocks myeloid differentiation
  - Targeted with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide

These fusion proteins typically exhibit altered subcellular localization, interacting partners, or catalytic activity compared to their wild-type counterparts, driving oncogenic signaling.

**Enhancer Hijacking**

Chromosomal rearrangements can juxtapose oncogenes to active enhancers from other genomic regions:

- **MYC translocations in B-cell malignancies**:
  - t(8;14) places MYC under control of immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer in Burkitt lymphoma
  - t(8;22) and t(2;8) variants involve light chain enhancers
  - Result in constitutive MYC expression in B cells

- **TCR enhancer-driven oncogenes in T-cell malignancies**:
  - Various translocations placing genes like TAL1, LMO1/2, and TLX1 under control of T-cell receptor enhancers
  - Drive inappropriate expression in T-cell development

- **Structural variants in solid tumors**:
  - GFI1 family oncogenes activated by enhancer hijacking in medulloblastoma
  - TERT activation through structural variants bringing distant enhancers into proximity

These rearrangements typically result in deregulated expression of the affected oncogene, with tissue-specific enhancers driving inappropriate expression in particular cellular contexts.

**Detection and Characterization of Chromosomal Rearrangements**

Multiple techniques are used to identify oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements:

- **Cytogenetic methods**: Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
  - Allow visualization of gross chromosomal abnormalities
  - Used clinically for specific recurrent translocations

- **PCR-based approaches**: Detection of specific fusion transcripts
  - Reverse transcription PCR for known fusion genes
  - Useful for minimal residual disease monitoring

- **Next-generation sequencing**: Comprehensive detection of novel and known rearrangements
  - Whole genome sequencing for comprehensive detection
  - RNA sequencing for identification of expressed fusion transcripts
  - Targeted panel sequencing for clinically relevant fusions

These technologies have revealed that chromosomal rearrangements affecting oncogenes are more prevalent in solid tumors than previously recognized, with potential therapeutic implications.

### 5.3.4 Increased Expression through Transcriptional and Post-transcriptional Mechanisms

Besides structural alterations, oncogenes can be activated through various mechanisms that increase their expression levels.

**Transcriptional Upregulation**

Increased transcription can result from various alterations:

- **Mutations in upstream signaling pathways**: Activation of transcription factors that regulate oncogene expression
  - WNT pathway mutations increasing MYC transcription
  - NF-κB pathway alterations upregulating anti-apoptotic genes

  - Histone modifications increasing chromatin accessibility at oncogene loci
  - DNA hypomethylation of oncogene promoters

- **Transcription factor dysregulation**: Changes in the activity or expression of factors controlling oncogene transcription
  - Loss of repressive factors
  - Gain of activating factors

- **Viral integration**: Insertion of viral promoters near oncogenes
  - Hepatitis B virus integration activating MYC or CCND1 in hepatocellular carcinoma
  - Human papillomavirus integration affecting nearby gene expression

These mechanisms increase the rate of oncogene transcription, leading to elevated mRNA levels.

**Post-transcriptional Mechanisms**

Oncogene expression can also be enhanced through alterations affecting mRNA processing, stability, or translation:

- **Alternative splicing**: Generation of oncogenic splice variants
  - Androgen receptor splice variants lacking the ligand-binding domain in prostate cancer
  - Constitutively active RTK variants lacking autoinhibitory domains

- **microRNA dysregulation**: Altered regulation by non-coding RNAs
  - Downregulation of microRNAs targeting oncogene mRNAs
  - Mutation or deletion of microRNA binding sites in oncogene 3' UTRs

- **RNA-binding protein alterations**: Changes affecting post-transcriptional regulation
  - Dysregulation of proteins controlling mRNA stability or translation
  - Alterations in splicing factors generating oncogenic isoforms

- **Translational control**: Enhanced protein synthesis
  - Mutations affecting upstream open reading frames (uORFs)
  - Alterations in translation initiation factors

These post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to increased oncogene expression at the protein level, often in ways that are not detected by DNA sequencing or transcriptional profiling alone.

### 5.3.5 Loss of Negative Regulation

Oncogenes can be activated by the loss of mechanisms that normally suppress their activity.

**Loss of Protein-Level Regulation**

Various proteins negatively regulate proto-oncogene function:

- **GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)**: Enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS and other small G proteins
  - Inactivation of NF1 (neurofibromin) in neurofibromatosis type 1 and various sporadic cancers leads to hyperactive RAS signaling
  - Loss of other GAPs in specific cancer contexts

- **Ubiquitin ligases**: Target oncoproteins for proteasomal degradation
  - Mutations affecting FBW7, which mediates degradation of cyclin E, MYC, and Notch
  - Alterations in other components of ubiquitin-proteasome machinery

- **Protein phosphatases**: Reverse activating phosphorylation events
  - Loss of PTPN11 (SHP2) regulation in various cancers
  - Inactivation of PTEN, which dephosphorylates the PI3K product PIP3

- **Inhibitory binding partners**: Proteins that sequester or inhibit oncoproteins
  - Decreased expression of negative regulators
  - Mutations disrupting inhibitory interactions

Loss of these negative regulators can lead to oncogene activation without direct alteration of the oncogene itself.

**Feedback Loop Disruption**

Oncogenic signaling pathways typically incorporate negative feedback mechanisms that limit their duration and intensity:

- **Receptor downregulation**: Internalization and degradation of activated receptors
  - Mutations affecting receptor trafficking
  - Alterations in endocytic machinery

- **Pathway-induced expression of inhibitors**: Induction of negative regulators as a consequence of pathway activation
  - RAS pathway activation normally inducing expression of Sprouty proteins and DUSP phosphatases
  - Failure of these feedback mechanisms in cancer

- **Inhibitory phosphorylation events**: Pathway-induced modifications that dampen signaling
  - Disruption of inhibitory phosphorylation sites
  - Loss of kinases mediating inhibitory phosphorylation

These feedback disruptions can amplify and prolong oncogenic signaling, contributing to malignant transformation and progression.

## 5.4 Key Oncogene Families and Their Roles

The landscape of human oncogenes includes diverse gene families with distinct functions in cellular physiology and cancer development. This section examines the major oncogene families, their normal functions, mechanisms of activation in cancer, and roles in specific malignancies.

### 5.4.1 RAS Family Oncogenes

The RAS family represents one of the most frequently activated oncogene families in human cancer, playing central roles in multiple signaling pathways controlling proliferation, survival, and differentiation.

**Structure and Normal Function**

The RAS gene family includes three members that encode highly homologous proteins:
- HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)
- KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog)
- NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog)

These genes encode small GTPases (21 kDa) that function as molecular switches, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. This cycling is regulated by:
- **Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)**: Promote GDP release and GTP binding, activating RAS
- **GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)**: Enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS, promoting inactivation

In their active state, RAS proteins interact with multiple effector proteins to initiate downstream signaling cascades, including:
- RAF-MEK-ERK pathway controlling proliferation and differentiation
- PI3K-AKT pathway regulating survival and metabolism
- RAL-GEF pathway affecting vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization

RAS proteins are anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane through post-translational lipid modifications:
- Farnesylation at the C-terminal CAAX motif
- Palmitoylation (for HRAS and NRAS) or a polybasic domain (for KRAS4B) providing additional membrane targeting

This membrane localization is essential for RAS function, positioning the proteins near receptors and downstream effectors.

**Mechanisms of Activation in Cancer**

RAS oncogenes are typically activated through point mutations that impair GTP hydrolysis:

- **Codon 12 mutations** (G12D, G12V, G12C): Most common, prevent proper interaction with GAPs
- **Codon 13 mutations** (G13D): Similar effect to codon 12 mutations but may retain some GAP sensitivity
- **Codon 61 mutations** (Q61H, Q61L, Q61R): Disrupt the catalytic mechanism for GTP hydrolysis

These mutations lock RAS in its active, GTP-bound conformation, leading to constitutive signaling independent of upstream stimulation.

RAS genes show distinctive mutation patterns across cancer types:
- KRAS: Most frequently mutated (~85% of all RAS mutations)
  - Predominant in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung adenocarcinomas
- NRAS: Less common (~15% of RAS mutations)
  - Predominant in melanoma and hematologic malignancies
- HRAS: Least frequently mutated (~1% of RAS mutations)
  - Found in head and neck and urinary tract cancers

Additional mechanisms of RAS pathway activation include:
- Loss of GAPs (e.g., NF1 inactivation)
- Overexpression of GEFs
- Amplification of wild-type RAS (rare)
- Alterations in upstream receptors or downstream effectors

**Role in Cancer Development and Progression**

Activated RAS plays multiple roles in cancer:

- **Proliferation**: Drives cell cycle progression through upregulation of cyclin D1 and inhibition of cell cycle inhibitors
- **Survival**: Inhibits apoptosis through PI3K-AKT signaling and regulation of BCL2 family proteins
- **Metabolism**: Reprograms cellular metabolism to support rapid growth
- **Angiogenesis**: Promotes blood vessel formation through induction of VEGF and other angiogenic factors
- **Invasion and metastasis**: Influences cell migration, invasion, and metastatic potential
- **Immune evasion**: Modulates the tumor microenvironment and immune cell interactions

These multifaceted effects make RAS a powerful oncogenic driver, with RAS-mutant cancers often exhibiting aggressive behavior and resistance to therapy.

**Therapeutic Approaches**

Despite decades of effort, direct targeting of RAS proteins has proven challenging:
- Lack of suitable binding pockets for small molecule inhibitors
- High affinity for GTP/GDP making competitive inhibitors impractical
- Redundancy in downstream signaling pathways

Recent breakthroughs include:
- KRAS^G12C-specific covalent inhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib) approved for NSCLC
- Approaches targeting RAS membrane localization
- Inhibitors of downstream effectors (MEK, ERK, PI3K)
- Synthetic lethal strategies exploiting vulnerabilities in RAS-mutant cells

The continuing efforts to target RAS reflect its critical importance in cancer biology and the significant clinical need for effective therapies against RAS-driven malignancies.

### 5.4.2 MYC Family Oncogenes

The MYC family of transcription factors plays a central role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism, with deregulated expression contributing to a wide range of human cancers.

**Structure and Normal Function**

The MYC family consists of three related genes:
- MYC (c-MYC): The prototypical family member, broadly expressed
- MYCN (N-MYC): Primarily expressed during development, particularly in neural tissues
- MYCL (L-MYC): More restricted expression pattern

These genes encode basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factors with several functional domains:
- N-terminal transcriptional activation domain
- Central region containing conserved MYC boxes I-IV
- C-terminal bHLH-LZ domain mediating DNA binding and protein interactions

MYC proteins function primarily as heterodimers with MAX, another bHLH-LZ protein, binding to specific DNA sequences (E-boxes: CACGTG) to regulate transcription. MYC-MAX complexes generally activate transcription by:
- Recruiting histone acetyltransferases
- Promoting transcriptional elongation
- Enhancing mRNA capping

MYC regulates thousands of genes involved in:
- Cell cycle progression
- Protein synthesis
- Metabolism
- Ribosome biogenesis
- Apoptosis
- Stem cell function

This broad regulatory role positions MYC as a central coordinator of cellular growth and division, responding to diverse mitogenic signals.

**Mechanisms of Activation in Cancer**

MYC family genes are activated in cancer through various mechanisms:

- **Chromosomal translocations**:
  - t(8;14), t(8;22), or t(2;8) in Burkitt lymphoma placing MYC under immunoglobulin enhancer control
  - Various translocations in other hematologic malignancies

- **Gene amplification**:
  - MYCN amplification in neuroblastoma (25% of cases)
  - MYC amplification in breast cancer, lung cancer, and others
  - MYCL amplification in small cell lung cancer

- **Increased transcription**:
  - Activation of signaling pathways that upregulate MYC (e.g., WNT, Notch)
  - Mutations in transcription factors or cofactors controlling MYC expression
  - Enhancer hijacking through structural variants

- **Increased protein stability**:
  - Mutations affecting phosphorylation sites that regulate MYC degradation
  - Alterations in ubiquitin ligases (e.g., FBXW7) that target MYC

- **Viral insertion**:
  - Activation by retroviral integration in animal models
  - Contributes to some virus-associated human cancers

These alterations lead to constitutive or elevated MYC expression, driving oncogenic transcriptional programs.

**Role in Cancer Development and Progression**

Deregulated MYC expression contributes to multiple hallmarks of cancer:

- **Cell proliferation**: Drives cell cycle progression by activating cyclins and CDKs while repressing cell cycle inhibitors
- **Cell growth**: Enhances protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis
- **Metabolic reprogramming**: Promotes glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and nucleotide synthesis
- **Genomic instability**: Induces replication stress and disrupts DNA damage responses
- **Angiogenesis**: Enhances production of pro-angiogenic factors
- **Immune modulation**: Affects tumor-immune interactions through various mechanisms
- **Metastasis**: Promotes invasive and metastatic phenotypes

MYC often cooperates with other oncogenic events (e.g., RAS activation) to drive full malignant transformation. High MYC levels can also sensitize cells to apoptosis, creating a requirement for complementary anti-apoptotic alterations during tumor evolution.

**Therapeutic Approaches**

Direct targeting of MYC has proven challenging due to:
- Lack of enzymatic activity
- Largely unstructured protein with few binding pockets
- Nuclear localization
- Functional redundancy among family members

Emerging strategies include:
- Disrupting MYC-MAX dimerization
- Targeting MYC transcription through BET bromodomain inhibitors
- Exploiting synthetic lethal interactions
- Targeting MYC-driven metabolic vulnerabilities
- Inhibiting downstream MYC effectors

The development of effective anti-MYC therapies remains a major goal in cancer research, given the widespread involvement of MYC in human malignancies.

### 5.4.3 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) form a large family of cell surface receptors that transduce signals from the extracellular environment, regulating various cellular processes. Several RTKs function as important oncogenes when aberrantly activated.

**Structure and Normal Function**

RTKs share a common molecular architecture:
- Extracellular ligand-binding domain (varies among different RTK families)
- Transmembrane domain
- Intracellular tyrosine kinase domain
- Regulatory regions specific to each RTK family

Major RTK families with oncogenic members include:
- EGFR family (EGFR/ERBB1, HER2/ERBB2, HER3/ERBB3, HER4/ERBB4)
- PDGFR family (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, KIT, CSF1R, FLT3)
- FGFR family (FGFR1-4)
- VEGFR family (VEGFR1-3)
- Insulin receptor family (IR, IGF1R)
- MET family (MET, RON)
- TAM family (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK)
- EPH receptors (EPHA1-8, EPHB1-4)
- RET
- ALK
- ROS1

Under normal conditions, RTKs are activated by ligand binding, which induces:
1. Receptor dimerization or oligomerization
2. Conformational changes activating the kinase domain
3. Autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues
4. Creation of docking sites for adaptor proteins and enzymes
5. Assembly of signaling complexes
6. Activation of downstream pathways (RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLCγ-PKC, JAK-STAT)
7. Receptor internalization and signal termination

This tightly regulated process ensures that RTK signaling occurs only in response to appropriate stimuli and is properly attenuated.

**Mechanisms of Activation in Cancer**

RTKs can be oncogenically activated through multiple mechanisms:

- **Overexpression**:
  - HER2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers
  - EGFR amplification in glioblastoma and other cancers

  - Common in glioblastoma (EGFR/TGFα) and other cancers

- **Impaired downregulation**:
  - Mutations affecting receptor internalization or degradation
  - Alterations in negative regulatory proteins

These aberrations lead to constitutive or enhanced RTK activation, driving downstream oncogenic signaling pathways.
