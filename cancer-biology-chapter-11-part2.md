## Summary

Cancer metabolism represents a fundamental hallmark of malignancy, with alterations that extend far beyond the classical Warburg effect. The metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer serves multiple functions: supporting elevated energy demands, providing building blocks for biosynthesis, maintaining redox balance, adapting to challenging microenvironmental conditions, and enabling interactions with stromal and immune cells.

Glucose metabolism is profoundly altered in most cancers, with enhanced glycolysis occurring even in the presence of oxygen. This aerobic glycolysis is driven by oncogenic signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MYC, and HIF-1α, and supported by overexpression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes. Beyond energy production, the glycolytic pathway provides intermediates for biosynthetic processes and contributes to the acidification of the tumor microenvironment.

Alterations in lipid metabolism include enhanced de novo fatty acid synthesis, changes in lipid uptake and mobilization, and context-dependent utilization of fatty acid oxidation. These changes support membrane biogenesis, energy production, and signaling processes. Amino acid metabolism is similarly reprogrammed, with glutamine serving as a critical nutrient for many cancers and various other amino acids playing specialized roles in cancer cell biology.

Mitochondria remain functional in most cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis through bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and signaling functions. The balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation varies widely across cancer types and contexts, highlighting the metabolic plasticity that enables adaptation to diverse conditions. Mitochondria also play critical roles in cell death regulation, redox balance, and interaction with the tumor microenvironment.

These metabolic alterations present opportunities for therapeutic targeting, with approaches including inhibition of glycolysis, targeting amino acid dependencies, disruption of lipid metabolism, and modulation of mitochondrial function. Several metabolic inhibitors have progressed to clinical testing, with some—such as IDH inhibitors—gaining regulatory approval. Challenges in metabolic targeting include metabolic plasticity and adaptation, the impact of systemic metabolism, heterogeneity within tumors, and the need for precise patient selection.

The field of cancer metabolism continues to evolve, with emerging areas including immunometabolic interactions, the influence of the microbiome, connections between metabolism and epigenetics, and the role of metabolism in therapy resistance. As our understanding deepens and technologies advance, metabolic targeting is likely to become an increasingly important component of cancer therapy, potentially complementing existing modalities and addressing currently intractable aspects of cancer biology.
