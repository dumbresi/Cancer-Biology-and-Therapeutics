# Chapter 9: Cell Cycle Control and Cancer

## 9.1 Regulation of Cell Cycle Checkpoints

The cell cycle is a tightly regulated process that ensures accurate DNA replication and faithful distribution of genetic material to daughter cells. Precise control of cell cycle progression is essential for normal development, tissue homeostasis, and prevention of diseases such as cancer. Central to this regulation are cell cycle checkpoints – surveillance mechanisms that monitor critical events and delay or arrest cell cycle progression when problems are detected.

### 9.1.1 Overview of the Cell Cycle

The eukaryotic cell cycle consists of a series of carefully orchestrated events divided into four main phases:

1. **G₁ phase (Gap 1)**: The cell grows in size, synthesizes proteins, and prepares for DNA replication. Depending on external conditions and cell type, cells may enter a quiescent state called G₀ or commit to division by passing the restriction point.

2. **S phase (Synthesis)**: DNA replication occurs, resulting in the duplication of the cell's genetic material. Each chromosome is replicated to form two sister chromatids connected at the centromere.

3. **G₂ phase (Gap 2)**: The cell continues to grow and synthesizes proteins necessary for mitosis. The cell verifies DNA replication completion and repairs any DNA damage before proceeding.

4. **M phase (Mitosis)**: Nuclear division occurs through five subphases:
   - **Prophase**: Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle begins to form.
   - **Prometaphase**: Chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules via their kinetochores.
   - **Metaphase**: Chromosomes align at the metaphase plate.
   - **Anaphase**: Sister chromatids separate and move toward opposite poles.
   - **Telophase**: Nuclear envelopes reform around the segregated chromosomes, and chromatin decondenses.

5. **Cytokinesis**: Physical division of the cytoplasm, typically beginning during late anaphase and completing after telophase, resulting in two daughter cells.

The duration of cell cycle phases varies considerably among different cell types, ranging from approximately 24 hours in rapidly dividing mammalian cells to days or weeks in slowly dividing cells. Some specialized cells, such as mature neurons or erythrocytes, permanently exit the cell cycle.

### 9.1.2 The G₁/S Checkpoint (Restriction Point)

The G₁/S checkpoint, also known as the restriction point in mammalian cells or START in yeast, represents a critical decision point where cells commit to DNA replication and completion of the cell cycle.

**Molecular Mechanism of the G₁/S Checkpoint**

The G₁/S checkpoint is primarily regulated by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and E2F transcription factors:

1. **Rb-E2F pathway**:
   - In early G₁, Rb is hypophosphorylated (active) and binds to E2F transcription factors, inhibiting their activity.
   - E2F target genes include those required for DNA replication and S phase entry (e.g., DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, cyclin E, cyclin A).
   - Rb-E2F complexes actively repress gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and other chromatin-modifying factors.

2. **Rb phosphorylation cascade**:
   - Mitogenic signals activate the expression of D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3).
   - Cyclin D forms complexes with CDK4 and CDK6, which begin the phosphorylation of Rb.
   - Initial phosphorylation partially inactivates Rb, allowing limited expression of E2F target genes, including cyclin E.
   - Cyclin E associates with CDK2, creating a positive feedback loop that completes Rb hyperphosphorylation.
   - Hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from E2F, enabling full transcriptional activation of S phase genes.

3. **Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs)**:
   - The INK4 family (p16^INK4a^, p15^INK4b^, p18^INK4c^, p19^INK4d^) specifically inhibits CDK4/6, preventing cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex formation.
   - The Cip/Kip family (p21^Cip1^, p27^Kip1^, p57^Kip2^) has broader specificity, inhibiting cyclin E-CDK2 and other cyclin-CDK complexes.
   - CKIs are regulated by both internal and external signals, integrating various inputs to control cell cycle progression.

**Integration of Growth Factor Signaling**

The G₁/S checkpoint integrates various extracellular signals to determine cell cycle entry:

1. **Mitogenic signaling**:
   - Growth factors bind receptor tyrosine kinases, activating Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.
   - ERK phosphorylates and activates transcription factors like Myc, which induces cyclin D expression.
   - PI3K-Akt pathway activation stabilizes cyclin D and inhibits GSK-3β, which would otherwise promote cyclin D degradation.
   - These pathways converge to increase cyclin D levels and activate CDK4/6.

2. **Anti-proliferative signals**:
   - TGF-β and related factors activate Smad transcription factors, which induce expression of p15^INK4b^ and p21^Cip1^.
   - Contact inhibition activates the Hippo pathway, leading to p27^Kip1^ upregulation.
   - These signals counteract mitogenic stimulation by inducing CKIs that block CDK activity.

3. **Metabolic sensing**:
   - Nutrient availability affects mTOR signaling, which regulates translation of cell cycle proteins.
   - Energy status sensed via AMPK can inhibit cell cycle progression under low-energy conditions.
   - Amino acid availability influences cyclin D1 translation and stability.

**The Restriction Point**

The restriction point represents a point of no return in G₁, after which cells are committed to completing the cell cycle even if extracellular signals are withdrawn:

1. **Temporal aspects**:
   - Occurs approximately 3-4 hours before S phase entry in mammalian cells.
   - In serum-starved cells re-stimulated with growth factors, the restriction point is reached after approximately 8-10 hours.

2. **Molecular basis**:
   - Establishment of the cyclin E-CDK2 positive feedback loop is critical.
   - E2F activates its own transcription, creating additional positive feedback.
   - Degradation of p27^Kip1^ triggers a bistable switch-like transition.

3. **Biological significance**:
   - Ensures that cell division occurs only when conditions are favorable.
   - Provides a unidirectional mechanism that prevents erratic cell cycle entry and exit.
   - Dysregulation of the restriction point is a hallmark of cancer cells, enabling them to proliferate independently of external signals.

### 9.1.3 DNA Damage Checkpoints

DNA damage checkpoints operate throughout the cell cycle to prevent cells with damaged DNA from proceeding, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. These checkpoints are active in G₁, S, and G₂ phases, with specific molecular mechanisms tailored to each phase.

**G₁ DNA Damage Checkpoint**

The G₁ DNA damage checkpoint prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering S phase:

1. **Sensor kinases**:
   - **ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated)**: Primarily responds to double-strand breaks (DSBs).
   - **ATR (ATM and Rad3-related)**: Responds to single-stranded DNA coated with Replication Protein A (RPA), often arising from replication stress or processing of other lesions.
   
2. **Signal transduction**:
   - ATM phosphorylates histone variant H2AX (forming γH2AX), creating a platform for damage-response protein assembly.
   - ATM and ATR phosphorylate the checkpoint kinases CHK2 and CHK1, respectively.
   - CHK1 and CHK2 amplify the signal throughout the nucleus.
   - ATM directly phosphorylates p53 on Ser15, while CHK1/CHK2 phosphorylate p53 on Ser20.
   - These modifications disrupt the interaction between p53 and MDM2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation).

3. **Effector mechanisms**:
   - Stabilized p53 induces transcription of p21^Cip1^, a potent inhibitor of cyclin E-CDK2.
   - p21^Cip1^ prevents Rb hyperphosphorylation, maintaining E2F inhibition and blocking S phase entry.
   - CHK1/CHK2 phosphorylate and inactivate CDC25A phosphatase, preventing the removal of inhibitory phosphorylations on CDK2.
   - These pathways cooperate to rapidly and robustly arrest the cell cycle, providing time for DNA repair.

**Intra-S Phase Checkpoint**

The intra-S phase checkpoint slows DNA replication when damage is detected during S phase:

1. **Activation pathways**:
   - Replication fork stalling or collapse triggers ATR activation.
   - DSBs that occur during S phase activate ATM.
   - Activation of the S phase checkpoint does not completely halt replication but rather reduces its rate.

2. **Mechanisms of replication slowing**:
   - CHK1 phosphorylates CDC25A, leading to its degradation and preventing activation of new replication origins.
   - ATM and ATR trigger degradation of the replication-initiating factor CDT1, limiting new origin firing.
   - The SMC1-SMC3 cohesin complex is phosphorylated by ATM, promoting fork stability.
   - ATR phosphorylates and activates FANCM, which can remodel stalled replication forks.

3. **Fork protection and restart**:
   - Checkpoint activation preserves the integrity of stalled replication forks, preventing their collapse into DSBs.
   - The checkpoint coordinates repair activities with replication restart.
   - Multiple pathways exist for replication restart, including homologous recombination and translesion synthesis.

**G₂/M Checkpoint**

The G₂/M checkpoint prevents cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis:

1. **Activation mechanism**:
   - Similar to the G₁ checkpoint, ATM and ATR sense DNA damage and activate CHK2 and CHK1, respectively.
   - G₂/M checkpoint activation can occur rapidly through post-translational modifications, not requiring transcriptional responses.

2. **Regulation of CDK1 activity**:
   - Mitotic entry is driven by cyclin B-CDK1 (also known as the Mitosis Promoting Factor, MPF).
   - CHK1 and CHK2 phosphorylate and inactivate CDC25C phosphatase, which normally activates CDK1 by removing inhibitory phosphorylations at Thr14 and Tyr15.
   - The checkpoint also activates WEE1 and MYT1 kinases, which maintain these inhibitory phosphorylations on CDK1.
   - p53 contributes through induction of p21^Cip1^ and 14-3-3σ, the latter sequestering cyclin B-CDK1 in the cytoplasm.

3. **Checkpoint recovery**:
   - After DNA repair, Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) phosphorylates multiple targets to inactivate the checkpoint.
   - WIP1 phosphatase dephosphorylates ATM, p53, and γH2AX, resetting the damage signaling.
   - Degradation of checkpoint mediators like Claspin allows CDC25C reactivation.

**Mitotic Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC)**

While not strictly a DNA damage checkpoint, the SAC ensures proper chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle:

1. **Mechanism of action**:
   - The SAC monitors kinetochore-microtubule attachments and tension.
   - Unattached or improperly attached kinetochores generate a "wait" signal.
   - The primary effector is the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which inhibits the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C).
   - APC/C inhibition prevents securin and cyclin B degradation, thereby blocking sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit.

2. **Key components**:
   - MCC consists of MAD2, BUBR1, BUB3, and CDC20 (an APC/C co-activator).
   - MAD1 and MAD2 localize to unattached kinetochores.
   - BUB1 and BUBR1 respond to improper attachments and lack of tension.
   - Aurora B kinase detaches incorrect kinetochore-microtubule connections, providing another chance for correct attachment.

3. **Checkpoint satisfaction and silencing**:
   - Proper bipolar attachment of all chromosomes leads to checkpoint silencing.
   - Dynein-mediated "stripping" removes checkpoint proteins from kinetochores.
   - p31^comet^ disrupts the MCC, releasing CDC20 to activate the APC/C.
   - Active APC/C ubiquitinates securin and cyclin B, triggering anaphase onset and mitotic exit.

### 9.1.4 Molecular Pathways in Checkpoint Control

Several key molecular pathways orchestrate checkpoint control, integrating multiple signals to ensure genomic integrity.

**The p53 Pathway**

p53, often called the "guardian of the genome," plays a central role in cellular responses to various stresses:

1. **p53 activation mechanisms**:
   - DNA damage triggers phosphorylation by ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2.
   - Oncogenic stress activates p53 via the ARF-MDM2 pathway.
   - Ribosomal stress releases ribosomal proteins that bind and inhibit MDM2.
   - Hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and other metabolic stresses activate additional p53 modifications.

2. **p53 modifications and regulation**:
   - Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, and neddylation.
   - These modifications affect p53 stability, localization, and transcriptional activity.
   - MDM2 and MDMX are the primary negative regulators of p53.
   - The MDM2-p53 feedback loop: p53 induces MDM2 expression, which in turn promotes p53 degradation.

3. **p53 transcriptional targets**:
   - **Cell cycle arrest genes**: p21^Cip1^, GADD45, 14-3-3σ
   - **Apoptotic genes**: BAX, PUMA, NOXA, FAS
   - **DNA repair genes**: DDB2, XPC, MSH2, POLK
   - **Metabolism-related genes**: TIGAR, GLS2, SCO2
   - **p53 regulatory genes**: MDM2, WIP1, PIRH2

4. **Non-transcriptional p53 functions**:
   - Direct binding to BCL-2 family proteins at the mitochondria to induce apoptosis
   - Interaction with DNA repair proteins at damage sites
   - Regulation of microRNA processing

**The Rb-E2F Pathway**

The Rb-E2F pathway controls the G₁/S transition and coordinates cell cycle progression with growth signals:

1. **E2F family diversity**:
   - **Activator E2Fs**: E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a - primarily activate transcription
   - **Repressor E2Fs**: E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, E2F7, E2F8 - primarily repress transcription
   - Different E2F family members regulate partially overlapping but distinct gene sets.

2. **Rb family proteins (pocket proteins)**:
   - **RB1 (p105)**: The prototypical member, primarily binds activator E2Fs
   - **p107 (RBL1)**: Preferentially interacts with E2F4 and E2F5
   - **p130 (RBL2)**: Mainly associates with E2F4 and E2F5 in quiescent cells

3. **Chromatin regulation by Rb-E2F**:
   - Rb recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) to remove activating acetyl marks.
   - Rb interacts with histone methyltransferases like SUV39H1 to promote repressive H3K9 methylation.
   - Rb associates with chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF to establish repressive chromatin structure.
   - Upon Rb hyperphosphorylation, histone acetyltransferases are recruited to E2F target promoters.

4. **Beyond G₁/S control**:
   - The Rb-E2F pathway regulates genes involved in DNA replication, mitosis, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
   - E2F1 can induce apoptosis when inappropriately activated, providing a safeguard against uncontrolled proliferation.
   - Rb interacts with tissue-specific transcription factors to regulate differentiation programs.

**The ATM/ATR Signaling Cascade**

ATM and ATR are master regulators of the DNA damage response, coordinating checkpoint activation, DNA repair, and cell fate decisions:

1. **Sensor complexes**:
   - **ATM activation**: The MRN complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) recognizes DSBs and recruits ATM.
   - **ATR activation**: The ATR-ATRIP complex binds RPA-coated ssDNA, with additional activation requiring the 9-1-1 complex (RAD9-HUS1-RAD1) and TOPBP1.

2. **Signaling amplification**:
   - γH2AX spreads along chromatin from damage sites, creating a platform for recruitment of additional factors.
   - Mediator proteins (MDC1, 53BP1, BRCA1) facilitate signal transduction.
   - CHK1 and CHK2 diffuse throughout the nucleus, propagating the damage signal.

3. **Crosstalk between ATM and ATR pathways**:
   - DSBs can be resected to generate ssDNA, activating ATR after initial ATM activation.
   - ATR can activate ATM under certain circumstances.
   - Both kinases converge on many common substrates, including p53 and CHK1/CHK2.

4. **Pathway choice and regulation**:
   - Cell cycle phase influences pathway activation and outcomes.
   - The type and extent of DNA damage affects the duration and intensity of signaling.
   - Feedback mechanisms eventually attenuate the response after repair or commitment to cell death.

**The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System in Checkpoint Control**

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates the stability of key checkpoint proteins, enabling rapid and irreversible transitions:

1. **Major E3 ubiquitin ligases in cell cycle control**:
   - **SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complexes**:
     - SCF^Skp2^ targets p27^Kip1^ and p21^Cip1^ for degradation, promoting S phase entry.
     - SCF^βTrCP^ regulates CDC25A and WEE1, controlling CDK activity.
     - SCF^Fbw7^ targets cyclin E, c-Myc, and Notch, limiting their accumulation.
   - **APC/C (Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome)**:
     - APC/C^Cdc20^ becomes active in metaphase, triggering anaphase by targeting securin and cyclin B.
     - APC/C^Cdh1^ is active from late mitosis through G₁, maintaining low CDK activity.
   - **MDM2/MDMX complex**: Regulates p53 stability in response to cellular stress.

2. **Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)**:
   - USP7 (HAUSP) deubiquitinates both p53 and MDM2, fine-tuning the p53 response.
   - USP28 stabilizes checkpoint proteins like 53BP1 and Claspin.
   - USP44 regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint by stabilizing the MCC.

3. **Non-degradative ubiquitination**:
   - Monoubiquitination and K63-linked polyubiquitination often regulate protein localization or activity rather than degradation.
   - The Fanconi anemia pathway involves extensive regulatory ubiquitination in response to DNA crosslinks.
   - H2A and H2AX ubiquitination contributes to DNA damage signaling and repair.

**Integration of Checkpoint Pathways**

Cell cycle checkpoints do not operate in isolation but form an integrated network that coordinates cellular responses:

1. **Pathway convergence**:
   - Multiple checkpoint pathways often converge on the same CDK regulators.
   - Shared components like p53 integrate inputs from various stress sensors.
   - The ultimate outcomes (arrest, repair, apoptosis, senescence) depend on the integration of multiple signals.

2. **Temporal coordination**:
   - Different checkpoints operate sequentially during cell cycle progression.
   - Feedback and feed-forward loops create precisely timed transitions.
   - Mechanisms exist to prevent premature checkpoint silencing before problems are resolved.

3. **Spatial organization**:
   - Many checkpoint components localize to specific subcellular structures (kinetochores, replication forks, damage sites).
   - Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling regulates accessibility of key regulators.
   - Phase separation and formation of biomolecular condensates may contribute to checkpoint signaling.

4. **Checkpoint adaptation and recovery**:
   - Cells can resume cycle progression even with unrepaired damage (adaptation).
   - After repair, checkpoint silencing mechanisms ensure timely cycle resumption (recovery).
   - The balance between these processes influences genomic stability and cell survival.

### 9.1.5 Checkpoint Function in Development and Tissue Homeostasis

Cell cycle checkpoints play essential roles beyond preventing genomic instability, contributing to development, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis.

**Developmental Regulation of Checkpoint Function**

Checkpoint stringency and mechanism vary during development:

1. **Early embryonic divisions**:
   - Rapid cell cycles with abbreviated or absent G₁ and G₂ phases
   - Attenuated checkpoint responses, particularly in the earliest divisions
   - Gradual establishment of checkpoint competence during development
   - In mammals, full checkpoint function typically established around gastrulation

2. **Developmental remodeling of checkpoint components**:
   - Transition from maternal to zygotic checkpoint proteins
   - Changes in the relative importance of different checkpoint pathways
   - Tissue-specific expression of checkpoint regulators
   - Alterations in checkpoint thresholds during differentiation

3. **Role in developmental decisions**:
   - Coordination of proliferation with patterning and morphogenesis
   - Influence on asymmetric divisions and fate determination
   - Contribution to developmental timing
   - Regulation of cell death during tissue sculpting

**Tissue-Specific Checkpoint Functions**

Different tissues display distinct checkpoint characteristics:

1. **Proliferative tissues**:
   - Intestinal epithelium, skin, and bone marrow maintain robust checkpoints.
   - Stem cell compartments may have specialized checkpoint mechanisms.
   - Transit-amplifying cells balance proliferation with genomic integrity.

2. **Post-mitotic tissues**:
   - Neurons and cardiomyocytes maintain certain checkpoint components despite cell cycle exit.
   - These components often serve non-canonical functions, such as DNA repair or metabolism.
   - Re-activation of cell cycle machinery in these cells is often associated with cell death rather than division.

3. **Immune system**:
   - Programmed DNA breaks during V(D)J recombination and class-switch recombination require specialized checkpoint responses.
   - Rapid proliferation during immune responses necessitates efficient checkpoint control.
   - Balance between genomic integrity and generation of diversity.

4. **Reproductive tissues**:
   - Unique checkpoint mechanisms during meiosis
   - Germ cells maintain especially stringent genome surveillance.
   - Sex-specific differences in checkpoint responses

**Checkpoint Dysfunction in Aging**

Age-related changes in checkpoint function contribute to genomic instability and tissue deterioration:

1. **Decline in checkpoint efficiency**:
   - Reduced expression or activity of key checkpoint proteins
   - Altered post-translational modifications affecting checkpoint signaling
   - Decreased DNA damage detection and repair capacity

2. **Cellular consequences**:
   - Accumulation of DNA damage and mutations
   - Increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities
   - Elevated cancer risk with age

3. **Tissue consequences**:
   - Stem cell exhaustion due to checkpoint-induced senescence or apoptosis
   - Impaired regenerative capacity
   - Accumulation of dysfunctional cells
   - Inflammatory responses to damaged cells

4. **Checkpoint-targeting interventions**:
   - Potential for rejuvenation through restoration of checkpoint function
   - Balance between cancer prevention and tissue regeneration
   - Selective elimination of checkpoint-deficient cells

The complex roles of checkpoints in normal physiology highlight why their disruption in cancer has wide-ranging consequences beyond simply enabling proliferation.

## 9.2 Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs)

Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) form the core machinery driving cell cycle progression. Their oscillating activities ensure the unidirectional and temporally coordinated execution of cell cycle events, from DNA replication to mitosis and cytokinesis.

### 9.2.1 Structure and Regulation of Cyclin-CDK Complexes

Cyclin-CDK complexes function as molecular switches that control cell cycle transitions through protein phosphorylation.

**Structural Features of CDKs**

CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinases with highly conserved structural features:

1. **Catalytic core**:
   - N-terminal lobe: Rich in β-sheets, contains the ATP-binding site
   - C-terminal lobe: Primarily α-helical, contains the substrate binding and catalytic residues
   - Activation loop (T-loop): Controls access to the catalytic site
   - PSTAIRE helix: Mediates cyclin binding and undergoes conformational changes during activation

2. **Key regulatory elements**:
   - Inhibitory phosphorylation sites: Thr14 and Tyr15 in CDK1 and CDK2, located within the ATP-binding site
   - Activating phosphorylation site: Thr161 in CDK1 (Thr160 in CDK2), located in the activation loop
   - Cyclin-binding interface: Primarily involves the PSTAIRE helix and adjacent regions

3. **Substrate recognition**:
   - Minimal consensus sequence: S/T-P (serine or threonine followed by proline)
   - Optimal recognition sequence: S/T-P-X-K/R (where X is any amino acid)
   - Additional specificity determined by cyclin binding and docking interactions

**Structural Features of Cyclins**

Cyclins are a diverse family of proteins defined by the presence of the cyclin box domain:

1. **Cyclin box**:
   - Conserved structural motif consisting of five α-helices
   - Mediates binding to the CDK partner
   - Present in one or two copies (cyclin fold)

2. **Variable regions**:
   - N-terminal and C-terminal regions differ significantly between cyclin types
   - Often contain regulatory elements like destruction boxes and localization signals
   - Contribute to substrate selectivity and interactions with other regulators

3. **Types of cyclins**:
   - **G₁/S cyclins**: Cyclin D (D1, D2, D3) - respond to extracellular signals
   - **S cyclins**: Cyclin E (E1, E2) and cyclin A (A1, A2) - drive DNA replication
   - **Mitotic cyclins**: Cyclin B (B1, B2) and cyclin A - control mitotic events
   - **Additional cyclins**: Cyclins C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, T - diverse roles, some outside direct cell cycle control

**Activation Mechanisms of Cyclin-CDK Complexes**

Full activation of cyclin-CDK complexes requires multiple steps:

1. **Cyclin binding**:
   - Induces conformational changes in the CDK
   - Repositions the PSTAIRE helix, properly orienting catalytic residues
   - Moves the T-loop to partially expose the catalytic site
   - This alone confers only ~0.4% of full kinase activity

2. **Activating phosphorylation**:
   - CDK-activating kinase (CAK) phosphorylates the T-loop (Thr160/161)
   - Stabilizes the active conformation
   - Creates binding sites for substrate recognition
   - Increases activity to ~100% when combined with cyclin binding

3. **Removal of inhibitory phosphorylation**:
   - WEE1 and MYT1 kinases phosphorylate Thr14 and Tyr15
   - CDC25 phosphatases remove these inhibitory phosphorylations
   - The balance between these opposing activities controls timing of CDK activation

4. **Relief from CKI binding**:
   - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) must be removed for full activation
   - Involves proteolytic degradation, sequestration, or phosphorylation of CKIs
   - Cell cycle-specific regulation of different CKI families

**Regulation of Cyclin Levels**

Cyclin levels oscillate throughout the cell cycle, primarily through regulated synthesis and degradation:

1. **Transcriptional regulation**:
   - **Cyclin D**: Induced by mitogenic signaling through pathways like Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK
   - **Cyclin E**: E2F-dependent transcription following Rb phosphorylation
   - **Cyclin A**: Induced by E2F early, repressed by E2F later
   - **Cyclin B**: Regulated by transcription factors including FoxM1 and B-Myb

2. **Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis**:
   - **G₁/S cyclins**: Degraded via SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes
     - Cyclin D: SCF^Fbw7^ and other F-box proteins
     - Cyclin E: SCF^Fbw7^ after phosphorylation by CDK2 and GSK3β
   - **Mitotic cyclins**: Degraded via APC/C
     - Cyclin A: APC/C^Cdc20^ in prometaphase
     - Cyclin B: APC/C^Cdc20^ in metaphase-to-anaphase transition

3. **Post-translational modifications**:
   - Phosphorylation affecting stability and localization
   - SUMOylation influencing activity and interactions
   - Acetylation modulating function in some contexts

4. **Subcellular localization**:
   - Cyclin B1 nuclear import at G₂/M transition
   - Cyclin D nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling
   - Spatial regulation contributing to proper activity timing

**Regulation of CDK Activity by CKIs**

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors provide an additional layer of CDK regulation:

1. **INK4 family (Inhibitors of CDK4)**:
   - Members: p16^INK4a^, p15^INK4b^, p18^INK4c^, p19^INK4d^
   - Specifically inhibit CDK4 and CDK6
   - Prevent cyclin D binding by inducing allosteric changes in CDK structure
   - Regulated primarily at the transcriptional level

2. **Cip/Kip family**:
   - Members: p21^Cip1^, p27^Kip1^, p57^Kip2^
   - Broader specificity, inhibiting multiple cyclin-CDK complexes
   - Insert into the catalytic cleft, blocking ATP binding
   - Complex regulation involving transcription, localization, and degradation

3. **Context-dependent functions**:
   - At low concentrations, p21 and p27 may facilitate cyclin D-CDK4/6 assembly
   - Phosphorylation of p27 by cyclin E-CDK2 triggers its degradation, creating a double-negative feedback loop
   - Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling affects availability to nuclear CDKs

4. **Stoichiometric considerations**:
   - CKI levels relative to cyclin-CDK complexes determine inhibitory potential
   - Redistribution among different cyclin-CDK complexes affects overall CDK activity
   - Threshold effects create switch-like transitions

### 9.2.2 Cell Cycle-Specific Cyclin-CDK Complexes

Different cyclin-CDK complexes regulate specific cell cycle transitions and events.

**G₁ Phase: Cyclin D-CDK4/6**

Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes link extracellular signals to the cell cycle machinery:

1. **Formation and regulation**:
   - Cyclin D synthesis induced by mitogenic signaling (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway)
   - Assembly assisted by chaperones HSP90 and CDC37
   - Activity regulated by INK4 family inhibitors
   - Sequestration of p21 and p27 from cyclin E-CDK2

2. **Substrates and functions**:
   - **Retinoblastoma protein (Rb)**: Partial phosphorylation, particularly at sites in the C-terminal region
   - **Rb-related proteins**: p107 and p130 phosphorylation
   - **SMAD3**: Inhibition of TGF-β-mediated growth arrest
   - **FOXOs**: Phosphorylation promoting cytoplasmic retention

3. **Tissue-specific roles**:
   - Different D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) show tissue-specific expression patterns
   - Redundant functions in many tissues but specific requirements in others
   - Specialized roles in differentiation of certain cell types

4. **Cyclin D-CDK4/6 as an integrator**:
   - Integrates mitogenic, anti-mitogenic, and metabolic signals
   - Links cell growth to cell cycle progression
   - Sets the threshold for G₁/S transition

**G₁/S Transition: Cyclin E-CDK2**

Cyclin E-CDK2 triggers the G₁/S transition and initiation of DNA replication:

1. **Activation mechanism**:
   - Cyclin E expression induced by E2F following initial Rb phosphorylation
   - Sequestration and degradation of p27^Kip1^
   - CDC25A removes inhibitory phosphorylations
   - Positive feedback loop establishing the restriction point

2. **Key substrates and functions**:
   - **Rb**: Completes hyperphosphorylation, fully activating E2F-dependent transcription
   - **Pre-replication complex components**: Licenses origins for DNA replication
     - CDC6: Phosphorylation regulating chromatin binding and nuclear export
     - MCM complex: Loading onto chromatin facilitated by CDK2 activity
   - **NPAT**: Stimulates histone gene expression
   - **Nucleophosmin/B23**: Centrosome duplication
   - **p27^Kip1^**: Phosphorylation targeting it for degradation

3. **Spatial and temporal control**:
   - Nuclear localization of activity
   - Peak expression and activity at the G₁/S boundary
