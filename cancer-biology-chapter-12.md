# Chapter 12: Angiogenesis

## 12.1 The Angiogenic Switch

Angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature—plays a critical role in cancer progression. While angiogenesis is a normal physiological process essential for development, wound healing, and reproductive functions, it is tightly regulated in adult tissues. In cancer, this regulation is disrupted, resulting in the formation of abnormal tumor vasculature that supports malignant growth and metastatic spread. Understanding the mechanisms that govern the transition from a dormant, avascular tumor to an actively growing, vascularized mass—the angiogenic switch—is fundamental to comprehending cancer progression and developing effective therapeutic strategies.

### 12.1.1 Physiological versus Pathological Angiogenesis

Angiogenesis in normal physiological contexts differs markedly from the pathological angiogenesis observed in tumors, with important implications for cancer biology and therapy.

**Physiological Angiogenesis**

Normal angiogenesis is a tightly orchestrated process that occurs primarily during embryonic development but also in specific adult contexts:

1. **Developmental angiogenesis**:
   - Establishment of primary vascular networks through vasculogenesis (formation of blood vessels from angioblasts)
   - Expansion and remodeling of these networks through angiogenesis
   - Hierarchical organization into arteries, capillaries, and veins
   - Maturation involving pericyte recruitment and basement membrane formation

2. **Adult physiological angiogenesis**:
   - Wound healing: Temporary activation to restore damaged vasculature
   - Female reproductive cycle: Cyclic angiogenesis in the endometrium and ovaries
   - Exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle
   - Adipose tissue expansion
   - Placental development during pregnancy

3. **Regulation and characteristics**:
   - Precise temporal and spatial control
   - Balanced production of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors
   - Coordinated activation and resolution phases
   - Resulting in functional, well-organized vessels with:
     - Hierarchical organization
     - Normal basement membrane
     - Appropriate pericyte coverage
     - Efficient perfusion
     - Low permeability

**Pathological Angiogenesis in Cancer**

Tumor angiogenesis differs substantially from physiological angiogenesis:

1. **Dysregulated process**:
   - Persistent activation without appropriate resolution
   - Imbalance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors
   - Disrupted spatial and temporal coordination
   - Abnormal response to environmental cues

2. **Structural and functional abnormalities**:
   - **Chaotic architecture**: Lack of hierarchical organization with irregular branching
   - **Tortuous vessels**: Aberrant, twisting morphology
   - **Uneven diameter**: Alternating wide and narrow segments
   - **Arteriovenous shunts**: Bypassing capillary beds
   - **Incomplete endothelial lining**: Creating gaps and fenestrations
   - **Deficient basement membrane**: Thin, discontinuous, or absent
   - **Inadequate pericyte coverage**: Loose association or absence of pericytes
   - **Mosaic vessels**: Some luminal surface lined by tumor cells rather than endothelium

3. **Functional consequences**:
   - **Heterogeneous blood flow**: Regions of high flow alongside stagnant areas
   - **Increased permeability**: Leading to elevated interstitial fluid pressure
   - **Hypoxia persistence**: Despite increased vessel density
   - **Impaired drug delivery**: Compromising therapeutic efficacy
   - **Enhanced tumor cell intravasation**: Facilitating metastasis

4. **Cellular origins**:
   - **Sprouting from existing vessels**: The predominant mechanism
   - **Vascular co-option**: Tumors hijacking existing vessels
   - **Vasculogenic mimicry**: Tumor cells forming vessel-like structures
   - **Endothelial differentiation from cancer stem cells**: Generating tumor-derived endothelium
   - **Recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells**: Contributing to new vessel formation

These distinctive features of tumor vasculature contribute to the challenges of treating cancer and have significant implications for the delivery of therapeutics to tumor tissue.

### 12.1.2 Molecular Basis of the Angiogenic Switch

The transition from an avascular, dormant tumor nodule to a vascularized, growing tumor—the angiogenic switch—represents a critical step in cancer progression and involves complex molecular mechanisms.

**Balance of Pro- and Anti-angiogenic Factors**

The angiogenic switch is fundamentally characterized by a shift in the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules:

1. **Pro-angiogenic factors**:
   - **Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family**: VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor (PlGF)
   - **Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)**: Particularly FGF1 (acidic) and FGF2 (basic)
   - **Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs)**: Important for pericyte recruitment
   - **Epidermal growth factor (EGF) family**: Including epiregulin and betacellulin
   - **Angiopoietins**: Particularly Ang-2 in the context of VEGF presence
   - **Interleukins**: IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-6
   - **Chemokines**: SDF-1 (CXCL12), MCP-1 (CCL2)
   - **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)**: MMP-2, MMP-9, and others
   - **Other growth factors**: HGF, TGF-α, TGF-β (context-dependent)

2. **Anti-angiogenic factors**:
   - **Thrombospondin-1 and -2**: First identified endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors
   - **Angiostatin**: Plasminogen fragment inhibiting endothelial proliferation
   - **Endostatin**: Collagen XVIII fragment with anti-angiogenic properties
   - **Tumstatin**: Fragment of type IV collagen α3 chain
   - **Interferon-α, -β, -γ**: Inhibit endothelial cell migration and proliferation
   - **Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)**: Counteract MMP activity
   - **Vasohibin**: Endothelium-derived inhibitor
   - **Angiopoietin-1**: Stabilizes vessels in mature state
   - **Soluble VEGFR-1 (sFlt-1)**: Sequesters VEGF, preventing receptor activation

3. **The switch mechanism**:
   - In dormant tumors, anti-angiogenic factors predominate
   - The angiogenic switch occurs when the balance tips toward pro-angiogenic factors
   - This can result from:
     - Increased production of pro-angiogenic factors
     - Decreased production of anti-angiogenic factors
     - Mobilization of sequestered pro-angiogenic factors from extracellular matrix
     - Recruitment of cells that release pro-angiogenic factors

The relative contribution of these factors varies across cancer types and stages, creating distinct angiogenic profiles.

**Tumor Microenvironment and the Angiogenic Switch**

Multiple components of the tumor microenvironment contribute to the angiogenic switch:

1. **Cancer cells**:
   - Primary source of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors
   - Production influenced by oncogenic signaling, hypoxia, and metabolic stress
   - Heterogeneous expression within the tumor

2. **Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)**:
   - Major source of pro-angiogenic factors including VEGF, FGFs, and PDGFs
   - Production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that can sequester or present angiogenic factors
   - Secretion of proteases that release matrix-bound growth factors

3. **Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)**:
   - Predominantly M2-polarized with pro-angiogenic functions
   - Production of VEGF, FGF2, PDGF, and MMPs
   - Physical assistance in vessel formation through anastomosis facilitation

4. **Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)**:
   - Release of multiple pro-angiogenic factors
   - Modulation of bioavailability of VEGF and other factors
   - Resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies

5. **Endothelial cells**:
   - Primary responders to angiogenic signals
   - Heterogeneity in responsiveness to angiogenic stimuli
   - Source of feedback regulators controlling angiogenesis

6. **Pericytes**:
   - Regulate vessel stability and maturation
   - Source of VEGF and other factors when activated
   - Altered coverage and attachment in tumor vessels

7. **Platelets**:
   - Reservoir of both pro- and anti-angiogenic factors
   - Release of growth factors upon activation in the tumor microenvironment
   - Direct interactions with endothelial and tumor cells

This complex cellular interplay creates a dynamic angiogenic microenvironment that evolves during tumor progression and in response to therapeutic interventions.

**Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation**

Genetic and epigenetic alterations contribute significantly to the angiogenic switch:

1. **Oncogene activation**:
   - **RAS mutations**: Enhance VEGF expression through RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
   - **MYC amplification**: Directly activates VEGF transcription and represses thrombospondin-1
   - **HER2 overexpression**: Increases VEGF production via PI3K-AKT-mTOR
   - **BCR-ABL translocation**: Stimulates VEGF expression in hematological malignancies

2. **Tumor suppressor inactivation**:
   - **p53 loss**: Reduces thrombospondin-1 expression and increases VEGF production
   - **PTEN loss**: Enhances PI3K-AKT signaling, leading to increased HIF-1α and VEGF
   - **VHL inactivation**: Prevents HIF-1α degradation, constitutively activating hypoxic response
   - **NF1 loss**: Increases RAS activity, enhancing angiogenic factor production

3. **Epigenetic mechanisms**:
   - **DNA methylation**: Silencing of anti-angiogenic factors like thrombospondin-1
   - **Histone modifications**: Affecting chromatin accessibility at angiogenic gene loci
   - **microRNAs**: Regulating expression of angiogenic factors and receptors
     - miR-126: Regulates VEGF signaling
     - miR-210: Induced by hypoxia, promotes angiogenesis
     - miR-34a: Targets pro-angiogenic factors, reduced in many cancers

4. **Metabolic regulators**:
   - **PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2)**: Nuclear translocation promotes HIF-1α transactivation
   - **IDH1/2 mutations**: Production of 2-hydroxyglutarate affecting HIF-1α stability
   - **SDH and FH mutations**: Accumulation of succinate or fumarate inhibiting HIF prolyl hydroxylases

These genetic and epigenetic alterations can drive the angiogenic switch independently of hypoxia, contributing to the constitutive angiogenic phenotype observed in many cancers.

### 12.1.3 Stages of Tumor Angiogenesis

Tumor angiogenesis proceeds through several distinct but overlapping stages, from initial endothelial activation to vessel maturation or, more commonly in tumors, persistent vascular remodeling.

**Endothelial Activation and Basement Membrane Degradation**

The initial steps in angiogenesis involve endothelial cell activation and degradation of the vascular basement membrane:

1. **Endothelial activation**:
   - VEGF and other factors bind to receptors on quiescent endothelial cells
   - Increased permeability allows extravasation of plasma proteins
   - Endothelial cells lose intercellular junctions and detach from neighboring cells
   - Transition from quiescent to proliferative phenotype
   - Selection of endothelial tip cells through Notch-Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) signaling

2. **Basement membrane degradation**:
   - Activated endothelial cells produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
   - MMPs degrade type IV collagen, laminin, and other basement membrane components
   - Plasminogen activators (uPA, tPA) convert plasminogen to plasmin, which activates MMPs and degrades matrix proteins
   - Release of matrix-bound growth factors (VEGF, FGF2, TGF-β)
   - Creation of provisional matrix supporting endothelial migration

3. **Pericyte detachment**:
   - Ang-2 antagonizes Ang-1/Tie2 signaling, destabilizing endothelial-pericyte interactions
   - PDGF-B signaling disruption
   - Proteolytic degradation of pericyte-endothelial contacts
   - Pericyte migration away from vessel wall

This initial phase creates the conditions necessary for subsequent endothelial cell migration and proliferation.

**Endothelial Migration and Proliferation**

Following activation, endothelial cells migrate and proliferate to form new vessel sprouts:

1. **Tip cell selection and guidance**:
   - VEGF gradient establishes endothelial cell specialization
   - Tip cells extend filopodia rich in VEGFR2 and neuropilins
   - Tip cells express high levels of Dll4, activating Notch in adjacent cells
   - Notch signaling downregulates VEGFR2 in stalk cells, reinforcing specialization
   - Tip cells follow chemotactic gradients of VEGF and other factors

2. **Stalk cell proliferation**:
   - Cells trailing the tip cell proliferate to extend the sprout
   - Balance between VEGF-driven proliferation and Notch-mediated restriction
   - Formation of a nascent lumen through vacuole formation and fusion
   - Establishment of apical-basal polarity

3. **Navigational cues**:
   - **Attractive signals**: VEGF, FGF, chemokines
   - **Repulsive signals**: Semaphorins, ephrins, netrins
   - **Extracellular matrix interactions**: Integrins binding to provisional matrix
   - **Mechanical forces**: Tension and shear stress influencing directional migration

4. **Endothelial metabolism in angiogenesis**:
   - Shift toward glycolysis supporting proliferation
   - Fatty acid oxidation sustaining vessel sprouting
   - Glutamine metabolism supporting redox homeostasis
   - Unique metabolic requirements creating potential therapeutic targets

This coordinated migration and proliferation establish the framework for new blood vessels that will eventually connect to form functional networks.

**Vessel Formation, Anastomosis, and Lumen Formation**

Nascent vessel sprouts must form lumens and connect with other vessels to establish blood flow:

1. **Lumen formation mechanisms**:
   - **Cell hollowing**: Intracellular vacuole formation and fusion
   - **Cord hollowing**: Reorganization of multiple cells to create a central lumen
   - **Budding**: Extension of existing lumen through coordinated endothelial movement
   - Establishment of apical-basal polarity through integrin signaling

2. **Sprout fusion (anastomosis)**:
   - Macrophages often facilitate tip cell encounters
   - VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion between tip cells
   - Resolution of overlapping filopodia
   - Establishment of continuous lumen through rearrangement of junctional complexes

3. **Initiation of blood flow**:
   - Perfusion creates shear stress
   - Shear stress induces vascular remodeling
   - Upregulation of Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and other flow-responsive genes
   - Vessel diameter adaptation to flow conditions

4. **Pruning and remodeling**:
   - Regression of redundant connections
   - Optimization of flow patterns
   - Elimination of non-perfused segments
   - Establishment of hierarchy (in normal vessels but often disrupted in tumors)

This stage transitions newly formed sprouts into functional vessels capable of carrying blood, though in tumors, this process is often aberrant, resulting in the structural and functional abnormalities characteristic of tumor vasculature.

**Maturation and Stabilization (Often Deficient in Tumors)**

The final stage of normal angiogenesis involves vessel maturation and stabilization, processes that are typically deficient in tumor vasculature:

1. **Pericyte recruitment**:
   - PDGF-B secretion by endothelial cells attracts PDGFR-β+ pericytes
   - TGF-β promotes pericyte differentiation and basement membrane production
   - Ang-1/Tie2 signaling stabilizes endothelial-pericyte interactions
   - S1P/S1PR signaling contributes to pericyte coverage
   - In tumors: Reduced pericyte coverage, abnormal attachment

2. **Basement membrane deposition**:
   - Endothelial cells and pericytes deposit basement membrane components
   - Type IV collagen provides structural support
   - Laminin establishes endothelial cell polarity
   - Perlecan and other proteoglycans bind and store growth factors
   - In tumors: Irregular, discontinuous basement membrane

3. **Endothelial quiescence**:
   - Reduced proliferation
   - Establishment of mature cell-cell junctions
   - Upregulation of quiescence-promoting factors like VE-PTP
   - Balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors favoring stability
   - In tumors: Persistent endothelial activation and proliferation

4. **Vascular specialization**:
   - Arterial-venous specification through Notch, ephrin, and COUP-TFII
   - Organ-specific endothelial phenotypes
   - Specialized barrier formation (e.g., blood-brain barrier)
   - In tumors: Chaotic organization without clear arterial-venous identity

In normal tissues, these maturation processes create stable, efficient vascular networks. In tumors, however, persistent pro-angiogenic signaling often prevents proper maturation, resulting in the structurally and functionally abnormal vasculature that characterizes many cancers.

### 12.1.4 Clinical Significance of the Angiogenic Switch

The angiogenic switch has significant implications for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies.

**Angiogenesis as a Rate-Limiting Step in Tumor Progression**

The requirement for angiogenesis creates a distinct bottleneck in tumor progression:

1. **Avascular phase limitations**:
   - Diffusion-limited growth restricting tumors to 1-2 mm in diameter
   - Balance between proliferation and apoptosis in pre-angiogenic lesions
   - Dormancy of micrometastases pending angiogenic capability
   - Oxygen and nutrient constraints on tumor cell metabolism

2. **Post-angiogenic switch consequences**:
   - Exponential growth enabled by improved nutrient and oxygen delivery
   - Reduced hypoxia and necrosis (though heterogeneity persists)
   - Enhanced capacity for invasion and metastasis
   - Altered tumor microenvironment affecting immune infiltration

3. **Evidence from animal models**:
   - RIP-Tag transgenic mouse model demonstrating distinct pre-angiogenic and angiogenic phases
   - Dormant tumors acquiring angiogenic capacity through specific genetic alterations
   - Correlation between angiogenic switch and invasive transition

4. **Clinical evidence**:
   - Increased microvessel density correlating with progression in many cancer types
   - Angiogenic biomarkers associated with transition from pre-malignant to malignant disease
   - Detection of angiogenic factors in early-stage cancers predicting progression

Understanding the angiogenic switch as a rate-limiting step has led to the development of anti-angiogenic strategies aimed at maintaining tumors in a dormant state even if complete eradication is not achieved.

**Prognostic Significance of Angiogenesis**

Measures of angiogenic activity often correlate with clinical outcomes:

1. **Microvessel density (MVD)**:
   - Quantification of tumor vascularity through immunohistochemical staining for endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, von Willebrand factor)
   - Associated with poor prognosis in many cancer types:
     - Breast cancer: Particularly in node-negative patients
     - Prostate cancer: Predictor of metastasis and disease-specific survival
     - Melanoma: Correlates with likelihood of metastasis
     - Non-small cell lung cancer: Independent prognostic factor

2. **Circulating angiogenic factors**:
   - Elevated VEGF levels in blood associated with advanced disease and poor outcomes
   - Soluble VEGFR-1 (sVEGFR-1) as a negative prognostic factor in some settings
   - Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio correlating with disease advancement
   - Patterns of multiple angiogenic factors providing more robust prognostication

3. **Genetic and molecular signatures**:
   - Angiogenic gene expression signatures predicting outcomes
   - miRNAs regulating angiogenesis as prognostic biomarkers
   - Imaging-based assessments of vascular function
   - Combined markers of angiogenesis and other cancer hallmarks

4. **Limitations and considerations**:
   - Variability in methodology affecting reproducibility
   - Heterogeneity within tumors requiring representative sampling
   - Context-dependent significance across different cancer types and stages
   - Need for standardization in assessment techniques

These prognostic associations highlight the clinical relevance of the angiogenic switch and provide rationale for anti-angiogenic therapeutic approaches.

**Angiogenesis and Metastasis**

The angiogenic switch facilitates metastatic spread through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Enhanced intravasation**:
   - Abnormal vessel structure with incomplete endothelial lining and basement membrane
   - Increased permeability facilitating tumor cell entry
   - Endothelial-tumor cell signaling promoting intravasation
   - Tumor-associated macrophages facilitating tumor cell access to vessels

2. **Preparation of the pre-metastatic niche**:
   - Systemic effects of angiogenic factors
   - VEGF-induced changes in distant organ vasculature
   - Bone marrow-derived cell mobilization and recruitment
   - Vascular "landing pads" for circulating tumor cells

3. **Support for metastatic colonization**:
   - Angiogenic capability as a determinant of successful colonization
   - Co-option of local vessels by metastatic cells
   - Induction of local angiogenesis to support metastatic growth
   - Variations in organ-specific angiogenic potential affecting metastatic patterns

4. **Clinical correlations**:
   - Correlation between primary tumor angiogenesis and metastatic disease
   - Predictive value of circulating angiogenic factors for metastatic progression
   - Preclinical evidence that anti-angiogenic therapy can reduce metastatic potential

The bidirectional relationship between angiogenesis and metastasis creates opportunities for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing or treating metastatic disease.

**Angiogenesis as a Therapeutic Target**

The critical role of the angiogenic switch in tumor progression established angiogenesis as a promising therapeutic target:

1. **Advantages of targeting angiogenesis**:
   - Affects multiple tumor types regardless of specific oncogenic drivers
   - Targets genetically stable endothelial cells less prone to resistance
   - Addresses a rate-limiting step in tumor progression
   - Potential for synergy with conventional therapies
   - Normalizes vasculature potentially improving drug delivery

2. **Challenges and limitations**:
   - Redundancy in angiogenic signaling pathways
   - Development of resistance through alternative mechanisms
   - Heterogeneity of tumor vasculature
   - Context-dependent efficacy across tumor types
   - Difficulty in identifying optimal dosing and scheduling

3. **Clinical implementation**:
   - FDA approval of numerous anti-angiogenic agents
   - Integration into standard-of-care for specific indications
   - Biomarker-guided patient selection strategies
   - Rational combination approaches
   - Management of class-specific toxicities

4. **Evolving paradigms**:
   - Vascular normalization rather than destruction
   - Immune modulatory effects of anti-angiogenic therapy
   - Approaches targeting vessel maturation and specialization
   - Organ-specific angiogenic targeting

The therapeutic targeting of angiogenesis continues to evolve, with greater recognition of its complexity and context-dependency informing more sophisticated clinical applications.

## 12.2 Key Angiogenic Factors

The angiogenic process is regulated by a complex network of growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that orchestrate the behavior of endothelial cells, pericytes, and other cell types involved in blood vessel formation. Understanding these factors and their signaling mechanisms is essential for comprehending tumor angiogenesis and developing effective anti-angiogenic strategies.

### 12.2.1 VEGF Family and Receptors

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family represents the most important and best-characterized regulators of angiogenesis, playing central roles in both physiological and pathological vessel formation.

**VEGF Ligands**

The VEGF family comprises several related growth factors with distinct properties:

6. **Viral VEGF homologs**:
   - VEGF-E: Encoded by parapoxviruses
   - VEGF-F: Found in snake venoms
   - Bind selectively to specific VEGFRs
   - Provide insights into receptor-specific functions

These ligands function primarily as dimers, with homodimers being most common, though heterodimers (particularly of VEGF-A and PlGF) can form with distinct biological activities.

**VEGF Receptors and Co-receptors**

VEGF ligands signal through a system of tyrosine kinase receptors and non-kinase co-receptors:

1. **VEGFR-1 (Flt-1)**:
   - Binds VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF with high affinity
   - Weaker tyrosine kinase activity than VEGFR-2
   - Functions:
     - Negative regulator during development (VEGF trap)

   - Functions:
     - Enhance VEGFR-2 signaling by facilitating ligand binding
     - Mediate interactions with extracellular matrix
     - Contribute to tip cell guidance
     - Expressed on tumor cells, affecting non-vascular functions

5. **Heparan sulfate proteoglycans**:
   - Bind and sequester heparin-binding VEGF isoforms
   - Serve as reservoirs that release VEGF upon proteolytic cleavage
   - Enhance VEGF-VEGFR interactions
   - Contribute to gradient formation and spatial distribution

The complexity of this receptor system allows for context-specific regulation of angiogenesis, with different combinations of ligands, receptors, and co-receptors producing distinct biological outcomes.

**VEGF Signaling Pathways**

VEGF receptor activation initiates multiple downstream signaling cascades that orchestrate endothelial cell responses:

1. **VEGFR-2 signaling** (primary angiogenic receptor):
   - **PLCγ-PKC-MAPK pathway**:
     - Activation of phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ)
     - Generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP₃)

   - **Notch**: Negative regulation of VEGFR-2 expression in stalk cells
   - **Semaphorins/Plexins**: Guiding tip cell migration in coordination with VEGF
   - **Inflammatory pathways**: TNF-α, IL-1β affecting VEGF signaling components

This complex signaling network allows for precise regulation of the diverse endothelial cell behaviors required for angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis.

**Regulation of VEGF Expression**

VEGF expression is regulated through multiple mechanisms that integrate diverse physiological and pathological stimuli:

1. **Hypoxia** (primary regulator):
   - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α, HIF-2α) bind hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the VEGF promoter
   - Rapid mRNA stabilization under hypoxic conditions
   - Increased translation through internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
   - HIF-independent hypoxic regulation through other transcription factors

2. **Oncogenic signaling**:
   - **RAS/MAPK pathway**: Activates Sp1, AP-2, and other transcription factors binding VEGF promoter
   - **PI3K/Akt/mTOR**: Enhances HIF-1α translation and direct VEGF transcription
   - **Wnt/β-catenin**: Direct transcriptional activation of VEGF
   - **STAT3**: Activated by various cytokines, directly increases VEGF transcription

3. **Growth factors and cytokines**:
   - **EGF, TGF-α**: Induce VEGF through MAPK and PI3K pathways
   - **TGF-β**: Complex regulation including Smad-dependent transcription
   - **IL-6, IL-8**: Activate STAT3 and other pathways enhancing VEGF production

4. **Hormones**:
   - **Estrogen**: Activates VEGF transcription via estrogen response elements
   - **Progesterone**: Context-dependent VEGF regulation
   - **Thyroid hormones**: Direct transcriptional effects via thyroid hormone response elements
   - **Androgens**: Regulate VEGF in prostate and other tissues

5. **Metabolic factors**:
   - **Glucose**: High concentrations enhance VEGF expression
   - **Reactive oxygen species**: Stabilize HIF-1α and activate other pathways
   - **pH**: Acidic microenvironment promotes VEGF expression
   - **Adenosine**: A2 receptor activation stimulates VEGF

6. **Epigenetic regulation**:
   - **DNA methylation**: VEGF promoter methylation status
   - **Histone modifications**: Affecting chromatin accessibility at the VEGF locus
   - **microRNAs**: Multiple miRNAs target VEGF mRNA (e.g., miR-20a, miR-93, miR-126)

7. **Post-transcriptional regulation**:
   - Alternative splicing generating different VEGF isoforms
   - mRNA stability regulated by AU-rich elements in the 3' UTR
   - RNA-binding proteins affecting translation efficiency
   - IRES-mediated cap-independent translation

This multi-layered regulation allows VEGF expression to integrate diverse microenvironmental and cellular signals, adapting angiogenesis to specific contextual needs.

### 12.2.2 Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Family

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family represents another important group of angiogenic regulators, often working in concert with or complementary to VEGF signaling.

**FGF Ligands and Receptors**

The FGF system is complex, with numerous ligands and receptors:

1. **FGF ligands**:
   - 22 members in mammals (FGF1-23, with FGF15 being the mouse ortholog of human FGF19)
   - Classified into canonical FGFs, hormone-like FGFs, and intracellular FGFs
   - Primary angiogenic factors:
     - **FGF1 (acidic FGF)**: Broad specificity across FGFR subtypes
     - **FGF2 (basic FGF)**: First angiogenic factor identified, potent endothelial mitogen
     - **FGF4, FGF5**: Additional pro-angiogenic activity
   - Most require heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding for receptor activation

2. **FGF receptors (FGFRs)**:
   - Four receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4)

The inflammatory component of tumor angiogenesis explains the associations between chronic inflammation and cancer progression, while also providing additional targets for therapeutic intervention.

## 12.3 Role of Hypoxia in Angiogenesis

Hypoxia—inadequate oxygen availability relative to tissue demands—is a fundamental driver of angiogenesis in both physiological and pathological contexts. In tumors, hypoxia arises from the imbalance between oxygen consumption by rapidly proliferating cancer cells and the limited oxygen supply from structurally and functionally abnormal tumor vessels. This hypoxic microenvironment triggers a coordinated adaptive response that promotes angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms.

### 12.3.1 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs)

Hypoxia-inducible factors are the master transcriptional regulators of cellular adaptation to hypoxia, controlling the expression of hundreds of genes involved in angiogenesis, metabolism, survival, and other processes.

**HIF Structure and Isoforms**

HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors with distinct regulatory and functional characteristics:

1. **Basic structure**:
   - Heterodimers consisting of an oxygen-regulated α subunit (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, or HIF-3α) and a constitutively expressed β subunit (HIF-1β, also known as ARNT)
   - Basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domains mediating dimerization and DNA binding
   - Oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDDs) in α subunits
   - N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains (N-TAD and C-TAD)

2. **HIF-1α**:
   - The most extensively studied isoform
   - Ubiquitously expressed
   - Rapid induction and degradation kinetics
   - Regulates acute hypoxic responses
   - Activates glycolytic metabolism genes and early angiogenic responses

3. **HIF-2α (EPAS1)**:
   - More restricted tissue expression
   - More stable under prolonged hypoxia
   - Particularly important in vascular endothelium and certain tumor types
   - Preferentially regulates erythropoiesis, stem cell maintenance, and specific aspects of angiogenesis

4. **HIF-3α**:
   - Multiple splice variants with different functions
   - Some variants act as negative regulators of HIF-1α and HIF-2α
   - Less well-characterized but emerging roles in hypoxic responses

5. **HIF-1β/ARNT**:
   - Constitutively expressed
   - Also partners with other bHLH-PAS proteins
   - Not regulated by oxygen levels
   - Essential for HIF transcriptional activity

These different isoforms allow for context-specific and temporally regulated responses to hypoxia across diverse tissues and physiological states.

**Oxygen-Dependent Regulation of HIF-α**

The regulation of HIF-α subunits by oxygen is a remarkably elegant system:

1. **Normoxic conditions**:
   - HIF-α subunits are continuously synthesized but rapidly degraded
   - Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD1-3) hydroxylate specific proline residues in the ODDD
   - PHDs require oxygen, iron, 2-oxoglutarate, and ascorbate as cofactors
   - Hydroxylated HIF-α is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein
   - VHL functions as the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
   - Ubiquitinated HIF-α is degraded by the 26S proteasome
   - Half-life of HIF-1α under normoxia is less than 5 minutes

2. **Hypoxic conditions**:
   - Reduced oxygen availability inhibits PHD activity
   - Non-hydroxylated HIF-α escapes VHL recognition
   - Stabilized HIF-α accumulates in the cytoplasm
   - Nuclear translocation via importins
   - Dimerization with HIF-1β
   - Binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) in target gene promoters
   - Recruitment of transcriptional co-activators (p300/CBP, SRC-1)
   - Activation of hypoxia-responsive gene transcription

3. **Additional oxygen-dependent regulation**:
   - Factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1): Hydroxylates an asparagine residue in the C-TAD under normoxia
   - Asparagine hydroxylation prevents interaction with p300/CBP co-activators
   - FIH-1 has lower oxygen affinity than PHDs, creating a graduated response to hypoxia
   - Initial inhibition of PHDs allows HIF-α stabilization while continued FIH-1 activity modulates transcriptional activity

This oxygen-sensing system allows for rapid and sensitive responses to changes in oxygen availability, with different thresholds for various regulatory components.

**Oxygen-Independent Regulation of HIF**

Beyond oxygen-dependent mechanisms, HIFs are regulated by numerous other factors:

1. **Growth factor and cytokine signaling**:
   - PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway enhances HIF-1α translation
   - MAPK signaling increases transcriptional activity through phosphorylation
   - STAT3 cooperation with HIF at target gene promoters
   - NF-κB-mediated induction of HIF-1α transcription

2. **Metabolic regulation**:
   - **Reactive oxygen species (ROS)**: Inhibit PHD activity, stabilizing HIF-α
   - **TCA cycle intermediates**: Succinate and fumarate accumulation (as in SDH or FH mutations) inhibits PHDs
   - **2-hydroxyglutarate**: Produced by mutant IDH1/2, affects HIF stability in complex ways
   - **Pyruvate and lactate**: Can inhibit PHDs independently of oxygen levels

3. **Post-translational modifications**:
   - Phosphorylation by multiple kinases affecting stability and activity
   - Acetylation modulating transcriptional activity
   - SUMOylation regulating stability and target gene specificity
   - S-nitrosylation enhancing stability by preventing degradation

4. **Protein-protein interactions**:
   - Heat shock proteins (HSP90) stabilizing HIF-α
   - RACK1 competing with HSP90, promoting degradation
   - Interaction with other transcription factors (e.g., c-Myc, p53)
   - Binding to scaffolding and adaptor proteins affecting localization

5. **Feedback regulation**:
   - HIF-dependent induction of PHD2 and PHD3
   - microRNAs regulated by hypoxia affecting HIF pathway components
   - Metabolic adaptations influencing oxygen consumption and hypoxic signaling

These oxygen-independent regulatory mechanisms are particularly important in cancer, where oncogenic signaling can drive HIF activation even under normoxic conditions ("pseudohypoxia").

**HIF Target Genes in Angiogenesis**

HIFs regulate numerous genes involved in angiogenesis and vascular function:

1. **Direct pro-angiogenic targets**:
   - **VEGF-A**: The prototypical HIF target gene with HREs in its promoter
   - **VEGFR-1**: Upregulated by hypoxia, potentially modulating VEGF sensitivity
